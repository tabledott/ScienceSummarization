ith quantified NPs one of whose readings is the original logical form, that is, how to do quantifier-lowering automatically.
    For this, we will associate a quantifier store with certain categories and add to the grammar suitable store-manipulation rules.
    Each category whose constituents may create store elements will have a store feature.
    Furthermore, for each such category whose semantics can be the scope of a quantifier, there will be an optional nonchain rule to take the top element of an ordered store and apply it to the semantics of the category.
    For example, here is the rule for sentences: s(Form, GO-G, Store)/quant(Q,X,R,S) ---&gt; s(Form, GO-G, [qterm(Q,X,R)IStore])/S.
    The term quant (Q,X,R,S) represents a quantified formula with quantifier Q, bound variable X, restriction R and scope S, and qterm(Q,X,R) is the corresponding store element.
    In addition, some mechanism is needed to combine the stores of the immediate constituents of a phrase into a store for the phrase.
