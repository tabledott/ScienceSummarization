s a transformation to the trees rooted in such nodes to make faster the kernel computation.
    The results show an increase of the speed similar to the one produced by our method.
    In (Zelenko et al., 2003), two kernels over syntactic shallow parser structures were devised for the extraction of linguistic relations, e.g. personaffiliation.
    To measure the similarity between two nodes, the contiguous string kernel and the sparse string kernel (Lodhi et al., 2000) were used.
    In (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) such kernels were slightly generalized by providing a matching function for the node pairs.
    The time complexity for their computation limited the experiments on data set of just 200 news items.
    Moreover, we note that the above tree kernels are not convolution kernels as those proposed in this article.
    In (Shen et al., 2003), a tree-kernel based on Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) for the parse-reranking task was proposed.
    Since QTK was used for the kernel computation, the h
