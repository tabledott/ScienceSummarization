s beyond those which human readers themselves are capable of making.
    In a well-known study, Kilgarriff (1992, 1993) shows that it is impossible for human readers to assign many words to a unique sense in LDOCE (see, however, the discussion in Wilks [forthcoming]).
    Recognizing this, Dolan (1994) proposes a method for &amp;quot;ambiguating&amp;quot; dictionary senses by combining them to create grosser sense distinctions.
    Others have used the grosser sense divisions of thesauri such as Roget's; however, it is often difficult to assign a unique sense, or even find an appropriate one among the options (see, for example, Yarowsky [1992]).
    Chen and Chang (this volume) propose an algorithm that combines senses in a dictionary (LDOCE) and links them to the categories of a thesaurus (LLOCE).
    Combining dictionary senses does not solve the problem.
    First of all, the degree of granularity required is task dependent.
    Only homograph distinction is necessary for tasks such as speech synthesis or
