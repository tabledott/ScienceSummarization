, phrase extraction produced 10% more phrase pairs, and the final translation system showed a loss in translation performance (BLEU score) below 1% relative.
    Given this outcome we decided to apply the faster procedure in all experiments.
    Once monolingual adaptation data is automatically translated, we can use the synthetic parallel corpus to estimate new language, translation, and re-ordering models.
    Such models can either replace or be combined with the original models of the SMT system.
    There is another simple option which is to concatenate the synthetic parallel data with the original training data and re-build the system.
    We did not investigate this approach because it does not allow to properly balance the contribution of different data sources, and also showed to underperform in preliminary work.
    Concerning the combination of models, in the following we explain how Moses was extended to manage multiple translation models (TMs) and multiple re-ordering models (RMs).
    In Moses,
