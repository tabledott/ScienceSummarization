ng pass.
    It is an obvious requirement of the mapping that lines of association should not cross.
    At the beginning of the relaxation process, the SAT is initialized such that the first sentences of the two texts, and the last sentences, are set in correspondence with one another, regardless of any words they may contain.
    The process that adds the remaining associations scans the WAT in order and applies a three-part process to each pair (v, w).
    Build a New AST.
    If there is to be another pass of the relaxation algorithm, a new AST must be constructed as input to it.
    This is based on the current SAT and is derived from it by supplying associations for sentences for which it provides none.
    The idea is to fill gaps between associated pairs of sentences in the same manner that the gap between the first and the last sentence was filled before the first pass.
    However, only sentence associations that are represented more than some minimum number of times in the SAT are transferred to th
