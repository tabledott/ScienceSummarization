his issue by assuming a single gold standard class for each verb (whether polysemic or not).
    The relatively good clustering results obtained suggest that many polysemic verbs do have some predominating sense in corpus data.
    However, this sense can vary across corpora (Roland et al., 2000), and assuming a single sense is inadequate for an important group of medium and high frequency verbs whose distribution of senses in balanced corpus data is flat rather than zipfian (Preiss and Korhonen, 2002).
    To allow for sense variation, we introduce a new evaluation scheme against a polysemic gold standard.
    This helps to explain the results and offers a better insight into the potential and limitations of clustering undisambiguated SCF data semantically.
    We discuss our gold standards and the choice of test verbs in section 2.
    Section 3 describes the method for subcategorization acquisition and section 4 presents the approach to clustering.
