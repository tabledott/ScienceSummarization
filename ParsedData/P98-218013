, if the relation watch&#8212;Means&#8212;gelescope were not in MindNet, it could be inferred by first finding the semrel paths between watch and telescope, examining those paths to see if another word appears in a Means relation with telescope, and then checking the similarity between that word and watch.
    As it turns out, the word observe satisfies these conditions in the path: watch&#8212;Hyp--observe&#8212;Means--telescope and therefore, it may be inferred that one can watch by Means of a telescope.
    The seamless integration of the inference and similarity procedures, both utilizing the weighted, extended paths derived from inverted semrel structures in MindNet, is a unique strength of this approach.
  
  
    An additional level of processing during the creation of MindNet seeks to provide sense identifiers on the words of semrel structures.
    Typically, word sense disambiguation (WSD) occurs during the parsing of definitions and example sentences, following the construction of logical forms (see
