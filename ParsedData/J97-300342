id not include the &amp;quot;foreign word&amp;quot; category (my) in the set of tags to guess, but this did not do too much harm because these words were very infrequent in the texts.
    And the third type of mistagging occurred when the word-POS guesser assigned the correct Pos-class to a word but the tagger still disambiguated this class incorrectly.
    This was the most frequent type of error, which accounted for more than 60% of the mistaggings on unknown words.
  
  
    We have presented a technique for fully automated statistical acquisition of rules that guess possible POS-tags for words unknown to the lexicon.
    This technique does not require specially prepared training data and uses for training a pre-existing generalpurpose lexicon and word frequencies collected from a raw corpus.
    Using such training data, three types of guessing rules are induced: prefix morphological rules, suffix morphological rules, and ending-guessing rules.
