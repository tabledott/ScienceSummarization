ic of spoken language, it is important for components like repair correction (which provide the powerful capability of deleting words) not to be applied in circumstances where no repair is present.
    In the 5875-utterance training set, Gemini misidentified only 15 sentences (0.25%) as containing repairs when they did not.
    In the 756utterance test set, only 2 sentences were misidentified as containing repairs (0.26%).
    While the repair correction component currently used in Gemini does not make use of acoustic/prosodic information, it is clear that acoustics can contribute meaningful cues to repair.
    In future work, we hope to improve the performance of our repair correction component by incorporating acoustic/prosodic techniques for repair detection (Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg, 1992) (Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993) (O'Shaughnessy, 1992).
    A central question about the repairs module concerns its role in a tightly integrated system in which the NL component filters speech recognition hypotheses.
