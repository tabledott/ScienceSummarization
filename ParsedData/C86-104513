onal application and functional composition is Steedman (1985).
			Forward functional composition permits the following combination ofcategories: (21) A/B + B/C = A/C The resulting category inherits the argument place for C from the argument B/C. Neither Steedman's nor any other CG I am aware of permits functional composition i its full generality.
			In order to prevent overgeneration, functional composition as well as other combination modes that are discussed by Steedman are restricted to apply to certain categories only.
			This somehow violates the spirit of a categorial grammar.
			Steedman's combination rules, for instance, are net universal.
			In CUG, functional composition is subsumed under functional application.
			It is the functor category that determines whether simple functional application, or functional composition, or either one may take place.
			Conjunction is a good case for demonstrating the versatility.
			Consider the following sentences: 3 (22a) Peter andPaul like bananas.
