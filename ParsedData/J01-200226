    We then switch to Wall Street Journal material (WSJ), tagged with the Penn Treebank II tagset (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).
    Like LOB, it consists of approximately 1M words, but unlike LOB, it is American English.
    Furthermore, it is of a different structure (only newspaper text) and tagged with a rather different tagset.
    The experiments with WSJ will also let us compare our results with those reported by Brill and Wu (1998), which show a much less pronounced accuracy increase than ours with LOB.
    The final corpus is the slightly smaller (750K words) Eindhoven corpus (Uit den Boogaart 1975) tagged with the Wotan tagset (Berghmans 1994).
    This will let us examine the tagging of a language other than English (namely, Dutch).
    Furthermore, the Wotan tagset is a very detailed one, so that the error rate of the individual taggers tends to be higher.
    Moreover, we can more easily use projections of the tagset and thus study the effects of levels of granularity.
