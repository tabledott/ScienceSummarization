 the choice on the bases of an unanalyzed intuition.
    In addition to the problematic cases, a significant number (120) of the 1000 triples identified automatically as instances of the verb-objectpreposition configuration turned out in fact to be other constructions.
    These misidentifications were mostly due to parsing errors, and in part due to our underspecifying for the parser exactly what configuration to identify.
    Examples of these misidentifications include: identifying the subject of the complement clause of say as its object, as in (10), which was identified as (say ministers from); misparsing two constituents as a single object noun phrase, as in (11), which was identified as (make subject to); and counting non-object noun phrases as the object as in (12), identified as (get hell out_of).
    Of course these errors are folded into the calculation of associations.
    No doubt our bigram model would be better if we could eliminate these items, but many of them represent parsing errors that ca
