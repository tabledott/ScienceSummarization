tion that we can estimate the likelihood of a subsignature assuming a multirtomial distribution.
    We can in fact do better than was indicated there, in the sense that for a given observed signature a*, whose suffixes constitute a subset of a larger signature a, we can compute the likelihood that a is responsible for the generation of a&amp;quot;, where {cb,} are the frequencies (summing to 1.0) associating with each of the suffixes in a, and are the counts of the corresponding suffixes in the observed signature a*: &lt;PI from Stirling's approximation.
    If we normalize the c,s to form a distribution (by dividing by [t]) and denote these by di, then this can be simply expressed in terms of the Kullback-Leibler distance Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language more general case.
    In the more general case, it is even more important to develop a model that deals with the layered relationship among suffixes in a language.
    The present system does not explicitly deal with
