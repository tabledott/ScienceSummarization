 and the last one reduces to [+ round].
    The whole expression on this instantiation of a is equivalent to { a , o, } fp, t, k, b, d... 1* {o, u, On the conventional interpretation, the original expression matches strings that belong to either of these instantiated regular languages.
    In effect, the variable is used to encode a correlation between choices from different sets of unanalyzable symbols.
    We can formalize this interpretation in the following way.
    Suppose 0 is a regular expression over feature matrices containing a single variable a for a feature whose values are drawn from a finite set V. commonly the set { +, -}.
    Let 0[a -4 v] be the result of substituting v E V for a wherever it occurs in 0, and then replacing each variable-free feature matrix in that result by the set of unanalyzable symbols that satisfy its feature description.
    Then the interpretation of 0 is given by the formula This translation produces a regular expression that properly models the choice-correlation defi
