    The following combinations are used for representing the characteristics of binary/unary schema applications.
    &#65533; RULE,DIST,COMMA, fbinary = SPANl, SYMl, WORDl, POSl, LEl, SPANr, SYMr, WORDr, POSr, LEr funary = (RULE,SYM,WORD,POS,LE) where subscripts l and r denote left and right daughters.
    In addition, the following is used for expressing the condition of the root node of the parse tree.
    Feature functions to capture predicate&#8211;argument dependencies are represented as follows: fpa = ARG, DIST, WORDp, POSp, LEp, WORDa, POSa, LEa) where subscripts p and a represent predicate and argument, respectively.
    Figure 20 shows examples: froot is for the root node, in which the phrase symbol is S and the surface form, part-of-speech, and lexical entry of the lexical head are saw, VBD, and a transitive verb, respectively. fbinary is for the binary rule application to saw a girl and with a telescope, in which the applied schema is the Head-Modifier Schema, the left daughter is VP heade
