mplete structure that connects two parallel sentences, and a link be one of the word-to-word connections that make up an alignment.
    All word alignment methods benefit from some set of constraints.
    These limit the alignment search space and encourage competition between potential links.
    The IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) benefit from a one-tomany constraint, where each target word has exactly one generator in the source.
    Methods like competitive linking (Melamed, 2000) and maximum matching (Taskar et al., 2005) use a one-toone constraint, where words in either sentence can participate in at most one link.
    Throughout this paper we assume a one-to-one constraint in addition to any syntax constraints.
    Suppose we are given a parse tree for one of the two sentences in our sentence pair.
    We will refer to the parsed language as English, and the unparsed language as Foreign.
    Given this information, a reasonable expectation is that English phrases will move together when projected onto
