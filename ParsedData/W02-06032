e language model, the number of basic units is very high and the estimated word n-grams are poor due to sparse data.
    (2) Due to the high number of possible word forms, many perfectly valid word forms will not be observed at all in the training data, even in large amounts of text.
    These problems are particularly severe for languages with rich morphology, such as Finnish and Turkish.
    For example, in Finnish, a single verb may appear in thousands of different forms (Karlsson, 1987).
    The utilization of morphemes as basic representational units in a statistical language model instead of words seems a promising course.
    Even a rough morphological segmentation could then be sufficient.
    On the other hand, the construction of a comprehensive morphological analyzer for a language based on linguistic theory requires a considerable amount of work by experts.
    This is both slow and expensive and therefore not applicable to all languages.
    The problem is further compounded as languages evolve,
