simply normalizes the partial counts to create a probability distribution.
    Normalization can be done over the whole table to create a joint distribution or per grapheme to create a conditional distribution.
    The Forward-many2many function (Algorithm 3) fills in the table &#945;, with each entry &#945;(t, v) being the sum of all paths through the transducer that generate the sequence pair (xi, y&#65533;&#65533;).
    Analogously, the Backward-many2many function fills in Q, with each entry Q(t, v) being the sum of all paths through the transducer that generate the sequence pair (xt , yr).
    The constants DELX and DELY indicate whether or not deletions are allowed on either side.
    In our system, we allow letter deletions (i.e. mapping of letters to null phoneme), but not phoneme deletions.
    Expectation-many2many first calls the two functions to fill the &#945; and Q tables, and then uses the probabilities to calculate partial counts for every possible mapping in the sequence pair.
