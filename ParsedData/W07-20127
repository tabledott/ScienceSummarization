			After the annotation of this data (see section 2.1.4.) we found our predictions about the averageambiguity of each dataset not to be completely ac curate.
			In Table 1 we see that the ECDL-06 average ambiguity is indeed relatively low (except for the documents for ?Thomas Baker?
			standing as the most ambiguous name in the whole training).
			Wikipedia names have an average ambiguity of 23,14 entities2We used the Yahoo!
