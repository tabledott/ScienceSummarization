 coherence (in the first case) or the detection of a global shift (in the second case) requires additional inferences.
    The first case concerns realization of the Cb by a nonpronominal expression.
    Rule 1 does not preclude using a proper name or definite description for the Cb if there are no pronouns in an utterance.
    However, it appears that such uses are best when the full definite noun phrases that realize the centers do more than just refer.
    They convey some additional information, i.e., lead the hearer or reader to draw additional inferences.
    The hearer or reader not only infers that the Cb has not changed even though no pronoun has been used, but also recognizes that the description holds of the old Cb.
    Sequences (17) and (18) are typical cases.'
    The second case concerns the use of a pronoun to realize an entity not in the Cf(Un); such uses are strongly constrained.
    The particular cases that have been identified involve instances where attention is shifted globally back to
