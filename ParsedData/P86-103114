onstraint [Japanese] (2nd approximation) Two zero pronominals that retain the same Cb in adjacent utterances should share one of the following properties (in descending order of preference): 1) SUBJECT, 2) nonSUBJECT.
    Constraint (9) predicts that retaining a Cb is good when the two pronominals are both either SUBJECT or nonSUBJECT while it is bad (i.e., leading to complex inferences) when one is SUBJECT and the other is not.
    This in turn predicts that changing the Cb across adjacent utterances is acceptable when the two pronominals have different properties while it is not when they are of the same property.
    The difference in acceptability between sequence (2) to (5) (marginal) and sequence (3) to (5) (acceptable) would then follow from this constraint.
    The former is bad because it changes the Cb with two SUBJECT zero pronominals, as shown in (10).
    The latter is good because it changes the Cb with different zero pronominals (from OBJECT to SUBJECT), as shown in (11): 10.: indicates the ass
