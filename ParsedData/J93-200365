    We include additional examples in Figures 11 through 15, which show the translation and fertility probabilities for external, answer, oil, former, and not.

    For example, in Figure 9, we see that t(lelthe) = 0.497 while the corresponding number from Figure 4 of Brown et al. (1990) is 0.610.
    The difference arises not from some instability in the training algorithms or some subtle shift in the languages in recent years
