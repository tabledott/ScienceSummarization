tionally perfect PP chunks, for GR assignment also perfect ADVFUNC labels. been 97.9% if all previous chunks would have been correct (+5.9%).
    For adverbial functions, the difference is 3.5%.
    For grammatical relation assignment, the last module in the cascade, the difference is, not surprisingly, the largest: 7.9% for chunks only, 12.3% for chunks and ADVFUNCs.
    The latter percentage shows what could maximally be gained by further improving the chunker and ADVFUNCs finder.
    On realistic data, a realistic ADVFUNCs finder improves CR assigment by 1.9%.
    On perfect data, a perfect ADVFUNCs finder increases performance by 6.3%.
  
  
    In this paper we studied cascaded grammatical relations assignment.
    We showed that even the use of imperfect modules improves the overall result of the cascade.
    In future research we plan to also train our classifiers on imperfectly chunked material.
    This enables the classifier to better cope with systematic errors in train and test material.
