the possible approaches to tackle this problem when tagging a corpus for NLP tasks.
    Zhou and Su (2003) investigated an approach to build a Chinese analyzer that integrated word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing, based on a hidden Markov model.
    Jing et al. (2003) focused on Chinese named entity recognition, considering issues like character-based versus word-based approaches.
    To our knowledge, our work is the first to systematically investigate issues of processing architecture and feature representation for Chinese POS tagging.
    Our maximum entropy word segmenter is similar to that of (Xue and Shen, 2003), but the additional features we used and the postprocessing step gave improved word segmentation accuracy.
    The research most similar to ours is (Luo, 2003).
    Luo presented a maximum entropy character-based parser, which as a consequence of parsing also performed word segmentation and POS tagging.
    The all-at-once, characterbased approach reported in this paper is essentially the
