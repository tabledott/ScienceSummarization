a Gaussian regularization term &#8722;G(&#955;) on the parameters &#955;.
    Let {(yj, zj)Imj=1 be a set of training data, consisting of pairs of sentences y and partial annotations z, let X(y, z) be the set of parses for sentence y consistent with annotation z, and let X(y) be the set of all parses produced by the grammar for sentence y.
    Furthermore, let p[f] denote the expectation of function f under distribution p. Then P(&#955;) can be defined for a conditional exponential model p&#955;(zIy) as: Intuitively, the goal of estimation is to find model pa'An earlier approach using partially labeled data for estimating stochastics parsers is Pereira and Schabes&#8217;s (1992) work on training PCFG from partially bracketed data.
    Their approach differs from the one we use here in that Pereira and Schabes take an EM-based approach maximizing the joint likelihood of the parses and strings of their training data, while we maximize the conditional likelihood of the sets of parses given the corresponding stri
