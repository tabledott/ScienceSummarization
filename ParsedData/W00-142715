 800K tokens and recorded the difference in timings; we took the averages of 10 runs.
    Despite its wide coverage the morphological generator is very fast: it generates at a rate of more than 80,000 words per second.5
  
  
    The morphological generator forms part of a prototype system for automatic simplification of English newspaper text (Carroll et al., 1999).
    The goal is to help people with aphasia (a language impairment typically occurring as a result of a stroke or head injury) to better understand English newspaper text.
    The system comprises two main components: an analysis module which downloads the source newspaper texts from the web and computes syntactic analyses for the sentences in them, and a simplification module which operates on the output of the analyser to improve the comprehensibility of the text.
    Syntactic simplification (Canning and Tait, 1999) operates on the syntax trees produced in the analysis phase, for example converting sentences in the passive voice to active, and
