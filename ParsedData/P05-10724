ich predicate argument relations are marked for verbs in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1994).
    PropBank was constructed by assigning semantic arguments to constituents of handcorrected TreeBank parses.
    Arguments of a verb are labeled ARG0 to ARG5, where ARG0 is the PROTO-AGENT, ARG1 is the PROTO-PATIENT, etc.
    In addition to these CORE ARGUMENTS, additional ADJUNCTIVE ARGUMENTS, referred to as ARGMs are also marked.
    Some examples are ARGM-LOC, for locatives; ARGM-TMP, for temporals; ARGMMNR, for manner, etc.
    Figure 1 shows a syntax tree along with the argument labels for an example extracted from PropBank.
    We use Sections 02-21 for training, Section 00 for development and Section 23 for testing.
    We formulate the semantic labeling problem as a multi-class classification problem using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (Hacioglu et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004) TinySVM2 along with YamCha3 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000;
