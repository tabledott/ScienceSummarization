ystem for English (Briscoe et al. 1987).
    Previous work has demonstrated that the ANLT system is, in principle, able to assign the correct parse to a high proportion of English noun phrases drawn from a variety of corpora.
    The goal of the work reported here is to develop a practical parser capable of returning probabilistically highly ranked analyses (from the usually large number of syntactically legitimate possibilities) for material drawn from a specific corpus on the basis of minimal (supervised) training and manual modification.
    The first issue to consider is what the analysis will be used for and what constraints this places on its form.
    The corpus analysis literature contains a variety of proposals, ranging from part-of-speech tagging to assignment of a unique, sophisticated syntactic analysis.
    Our eventual goal is to recover a semantically and pragmatically appropriate syntactic analysis capable of supporting semantic interpretation.
    Two stringent requirements follow immediately
