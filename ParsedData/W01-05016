le with co-training.
    In experiments with the CT algorithm, they noticed that it is important to preserve the distribution of class labels in the growing body of labeled data.
    Finally, they demonstrated the effectiveness of co-training on a web page classification task similar to that described above.
    Collins and Singer (1999) were concerned that the CT algorithm does not strongly enforce the requirement that hypothesis functions should be compatible with the unlabeled data.
    They introduced an algorithm, CoBoost, that directly minimizes mismatch between views of the unlabeled data, using a combination of ideas from co-training and AdaBoost (Freund and Shapire, 1997).
    Nigam and Ghani (2000) performed the most thorough empirical investigation of the desideratum of conditional independence of views underlying co-training.
    Their experiments suggested that view independence does indeed affect the performance of co-training; but that CT, when compared to other algorithms that use labeled and
