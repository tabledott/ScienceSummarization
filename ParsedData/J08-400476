e reliability of two different segmentation schemes&#8212;into broad &#8220;discourse segments&#8221; and into finer &#8220;discourse units&#8221;&#8212;on a text of 50 utterances, and that we obtain the results in Table 8.
    Case 1 would be a situation in which Coder A and Coder B agree that the text consists of two segments, obviously agree on its initial and final boundaries, but disagree by one position on the intermediate boundary&#8212;say, one of them places it at utterance 25, the other at utterance 26.
    Nevertheless, because expected agreement is so high&#8212;the coders agree on the classification of 98% of the utterances&#8212;the value of K is fairly low.
    In case 2, the coders disagree on three times as many utterances, but K is higher than in the first case because expected agreement is substantially lower (Ae = 0.53).
    The fact that coders mostly agree on the &#8220;bulk&#8221; of discourse segments, but tend to disagree on their boundaries, also makes it likely that an all-or-nothin
