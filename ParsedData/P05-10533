formance inprovement from syntactic aspect while additional full parsing information does not contribute much, largely due to the fact that most of relations defined in ACE corpus are within a very short distance.
    We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and Name List can be used in the feature-based framework.
    Evaluation shows that the incorporation of diverse features enables our system achieve best reported performance.
    It also shows that our feature-based approach outperforms tree kernel-based approaches by 11 F-measure in relation detection and more than 20 F-measure in relation detection and classification on the 5 ACE relation types.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 presents related work.
    Section 3 and Section 4 describe our approach and various features employed respectively.
    Finally, we present experimental setting and results in Section 5 and conclude with some general observations in relation extraction in Sectio
