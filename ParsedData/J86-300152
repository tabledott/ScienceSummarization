abstracted from the cognitive states of the discourse participants.
    The various components of discourse structure discussed so far are properties of the discourse itself, not of the discourse participants.
    To use the theory in constructing computational models requires determining how each of the individual components projects onto the model of an individual discourse participant.
    In this regard, the principal issues include specifying In essence, the OCP must judge for each utterance whether it starts a new segment, ends the current one (and possibly some of its embedding segments), or contributes to the current one.
    The information available to the OCP for recognizing that an utterance starts a new segment includes any explicit linguistic cues contained in the utterance (see Section 69) as well as the relationship between its utterance-level intentions and the active DSPs (i.e., those in some focus space that is still on the stack).
    Likewise, the fact that an utterance ends a segment may
