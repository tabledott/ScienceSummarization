s that in some cases, a constituent in one sentence may have several potential matches in the other, and the matching heuristic may be unable to discriminate between the options.
    In the sentence pair of Figure 4, for example, both Security Bureau and police station are potential lexical matches to !/_`,-VN.
    To choose the best set of matchings, an optimization over some measure of overlap between the structural analysis of the two sentences is needed.
    Previous approaches to phrasal matching employ arbitrary heuristic functions on, say, the number of matched subconstituents.
    Our method attacks the weaknesses of the parse-parse-match procedure by using (1) only a translation lexicon with no language-specific grammar, (2) a bilingual rather than monolingual formalism, and (3) a probabilistic formulation for resolving the choice between candidate arrangements.
    The approach differs in its single-stage operation that simultaneously chooses the constituents of each sentence and the matchings betwe
