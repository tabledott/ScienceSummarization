  Each argument Si can take any label from a set of argument labels, P , and the indexed set of arguments can take a set of labels, c1:M ?
  If we assume that the argument classifier returns an estimated conditional probability distribution, Prob(Si = ci), then, given a sentence, the inference procedure seeks a global assignment that maximizes the objective function denoted by Equation (2), which can be rewritten as follows, c?1:M = argmax c1:M?F
