f parsers trained on CCGbank can also be directly translated into logical forms such as Discourse Representation Theory structures (Kamp and Reyle 1993), which can then be used as input to a theorem prover in applications like question answering and textual entailment recognition.
    Translating the Treebank into this more demanding formalism has revealed certain sources of noise and inconsistency in the original annotation that have had to be corrected in order to permit induction of a linguistically correct grammar.
    Because of this preprocessing, the dependency structures in CCGbank are likely to be more consistent than those extracted directly from the Treebank via heuristics such as those given by Magerman (1994) and Collins (1999), and therefore may also be of immediate use for dependency-based approaches.
    However, the structure of certain constructions, such as compound nouns or fragments, is deliberately underspecified in the Penn Treebank.
