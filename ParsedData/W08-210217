irst-stage model we use is a first-order dependency model, with labeled dependencies, as described in (McDonald et al., 2005).
    As described shortly, we will use this model to compute marginal scores for dependencies in both training and test sentences.
    A marginal score &#181;(x, h, m, l) is a value between 0 and 1 that reflects the plausibility of a dependency for sentence x with head-word xh, modifier word xm, and label l. In the first-stage pruning model the labels l are triples of non-terminals representing grammatical relations, as described in section 2.1 of this paper&#8212;for example, one possible label would be (VP VBD NP), and in general any triple of nonterminals is possible.
    Given a sentence x, and an index m of a word in that sentence, we define DMAX(x, m) to be the highest scoring dependency with m as a modifier: DMAX(x, m) = max &#181;(x, h, m, l) h,l For a sentence x, we then define the set of allowable dependencies to be to the number of non-terminals in the grammar, which is far
