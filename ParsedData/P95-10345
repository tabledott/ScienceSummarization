choice for point-time adjuncts to at, the most commonly used preposition in such cases.
    The FUF/SURGE (Elhadad, 1993) generation system is an example where prepositional lexical restrictions in time adjuncts are encoded by hand, producing fluent expressions but at the cost of a larger grammar.
    Collocational restrictions are another example of lexical constraints.
    Phrases such as three straight victories, which are frequently used in sports reports to express historical information, can be decomposed semantically into the head noun plus its modifiers.
    However, when ellipsis of the head noun is considered, a detailed corpus analysis of actual basketball game reports (Robin, 1995) shows that the forms won/lost three straight X, won/lost three consecutive X, and won/lost three straight are regularly used, but the form *won/lost three consecutive is not.
    To achieve fluent output within the knowledge-based generation paradigm, lexical constraints of this type must be explicitly identified and re
