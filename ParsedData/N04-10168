    The task is illustrated in (1) where there are five translation alternatives for the German noun Geschichte listed in curly brackets, the first being the correct one.
    Statistical approaches to target word selection rely on bilingual lexica to provide all possible translations of words in the source language.
    Once the set of translation candidates is generated, statistical information gathered from target language corpora is used to select the most appropriate alternative (Dagan and Itai, 1994).
    The task is somewhat simplified by Grefenstette (1998) and Prescher et al. (2000) who do not produce a translation of the entire sentence.
    Instead, they focus on specific syntactic relations.
    Grefenstette translates compounds from German and Spanish into English, and uses BNC frequencies as a filter for cand
