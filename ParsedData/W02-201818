e same for all of the algorithms.
    For the &#8216;summary&#8217; dataset, however, they differ by up to two orders of magnitude.
    This is an indication that the convergence test in (6) is sensitive to the rate of convergence and thus to the choice of algorithm.
    Any degree of precision desired could be reached by any of the algorithms, with the appropriate value of &#949;.
    However, GIS, say, would require many more iterations than reported in Table 2 to reach the precision achieved by the limited memory variable metric algorithm.
    Third, the prediction accuracy is, in most cases, more or less the same for all of the algorithms.
    Some variability is to be expected&#8212;all of the data sets being considered here are badly ill-conditioned, and many different models will yield the same likelihood.
    In a few cases, however, the prediction accuracy differs more substantially.
    For the two SAVG data sets (&#8216;rules&#8217; and &#8216;lex&#8217;), GIS has a small advantage over the other m
