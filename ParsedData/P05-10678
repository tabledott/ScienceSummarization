embly of indivisible sub-sentential elementary trees (ETs), we can find a proper way to transduce the input tree to the output tree.
    An ET is a single &#8220;symbol&#8221; in a transducer&#8217;s language.
    As shown in Figure 2, each circle stands for an ET and thick arrows denote the transduction of each ET as a single symbol.
  
  
    As the start to our syntax-based SMT system, the SDIG must be learned from the parallel corpora.
    One straightforward way to induce a generative grammar is using EM style estimation on the generative process.
    Different versions of such training algorithms can be found in (Hajic et al., 2002; Eisner 2003; Gildea 2003; Graehl and Knight 2004).
    However, a synchronous derivation process cannot handle two types of cross-language mappings: crossing-dependencies (parent-descendent switch) and broken dependencies (descendent appears elsewhere), which are illustrated below: In the above graph, the two sides are English and the foreign dependency trees.
