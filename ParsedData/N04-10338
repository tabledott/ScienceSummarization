mate the probability of those phrases.
    To overcome this problem, we use a word-based lexicon model to smooth the phrase translation probabilities.
    For a source word f and a target phrase e&#732; = ei2 This models a disjunctive interaction, also called noisyOR gate (Pearl, 1988).
    The idea is that there are multiple independent causes ei2 i1 that can generate an event f. It can be easily integrated into the search algorithm.
    The corresponding feature function is: hlex(fJ1 , eI1, S, K) = log K H7 k p(f7|&#732;ek) H 7=7k&#8722;1+1 k=1 Here, jk and ik denote the final position of phrase number k in the source and the target sentence, respectively, and we define j0 := 0 and i0 := 0.
    To estimate the single-word based translation probabilities p(f|e), we use smoothed relative frequencies.
    The smoothing method we apply is absolute discounting with interpolation: This method is well known from language modeling (Ney et al., 1997).
    Here, d is the nonnegative discounting parameter, &#945;(e) i
