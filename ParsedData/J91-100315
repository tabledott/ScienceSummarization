 metaphor constitutes a violation of selection restriction rules within a given context, where the fact of this violation is supposed to explain the semantic tension one experiences in comprehending any live metaphor.
    The theory of metaphor in Preference Semantics (Wilks 1975; 1978) consists of a selection restrictions view and a comparison view.
    In the theory, information about word senses is contained in knowledge structures called &amp;quot;semantic formulas.&amp;quot; An algorithm matches pairs of semantic formulas, seeking satisfied or violated preferences between them.
    A satisfied preference indicates a literal semantic relation; a violated preference indicates either a metaphorical or anomalous one.
    This part of the theory is implemented in a machine translation system (Wilks 1973).
    To distinguish metaphor from anomaly, a different knowledge structure and a second algorithm are used.
    The algorithm, called projection, operates on a knowledge structure, called a pseudo-text, that
