    Each rule in the grammar, ri, is generated from its root symbol, zi, by first choosing a rule type ti E {TERM, NON-TERM} from a Bernoulli distribution, ri &#8212; Bernoulli(-y).
    We treat -y as a random variable with its own prior, -y &#8212; Beta(aR, aR) and integrate out the parameters, -y.
    This results in the following conditional probability for ti: where n&#8722;i ri,zi is the number of times ri has been used to rewrite zi in the set of all other rules, r&#8722;i, and n&#8722;i r,zi is the total count of rewriting zi.
    The Dirichlet (and thus Beta) distribution are exchangeable, meaning that any permutation of its events are equiprobable.
    This allows us to reason about each event given previous and subsequent events (i.e., treat each item as the &#8216;last&#8217;.)
    When ti = NON-TERM, we generate a binary or ternary non-terminal production.
    The nonterminal sequence and alignment are drawn from (z, a) &#8212; ON zi and, as before, we define a prior over the p
