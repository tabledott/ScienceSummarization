expectations created by syntactic cues or whether it satisfies role-related expectations, the system must first perform some syntactic analysis of the input.
    Identifying these properties must come after parsing, because recognizing them requires both the structural cues provided by parsing and a semantic analysis of the text.
    In our system, processing occurs in three phases: morphology, preprocessing, and parsing and semantic interpretation.
    (See Figure 14.)
    Analysis of a text begins with the identification of the morphological features of each word and the retrieval of the (core) senses of each word.
    Then, the input passes through a special preprocessor that identifies parse-independent semantic preferences (i.e., syntactic tags, collocations, and clusters) and makes a preliminary selection of word senses.
    This selection process eliminates those core senses that are obviously inappropriate and triggers certain The system architecture. specialized senses.
