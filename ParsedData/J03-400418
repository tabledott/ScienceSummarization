or frequency data for the gr irrespective of the co-occurring verbs.
    The probability at the hypernym nc' will necessarily total the probability at all hyponyms, since the frequency credit of hyponyms is propagated to hypernyms.
    Thus, to disambiguate a noun occurring in a given relationship with a given verb, the nc E Cn that gives the largest estimate for p(nc|vc,gr) is taken, where the verb class (vc) is that which maximizes this estimate from Cv.
    The TCM acquired for each vc of the verb in the given gr provides an estimate for p(nc'|vc,gr), and the estimate for nc is obtained as in equation (16).
    For example, one target noun was letter, which occurred as the direct object of sign in our parses of the SENSEVAL-2 data.
    The TCM that maximized the probability estimate for p(nc|vc,direct object) is shown in Figure 5.
    The noun letter is disambiguated by comparing the probability estimates on the TCM above the five senses of letter multiplied by the proportion of that probability mass attri
