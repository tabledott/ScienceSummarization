ntic database such as WordNet (Miller, 1990) seems to have a great potential for this task.
    There are, at least, two obvious reasons: However, the general feeling within the information retrieval community is that dealing explicitly with semantic information does not improve significantly the performance of text retrieval systems.
    This impression is founded on the results of some experiments measuring the role of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) for text retrieval, on one hand, and some attempts to exploit the features of WordNet and other lexical databases, on the other hand.
    In (Sanderson, 1994), word sense ambiguity is shown to produce only minor effects on retrieval accuracy, apparently confirming that query/document matching strategies already perform an implicit disambiguation.
    Sanderson also estimates that if explicit WSD is performed with less than 90% accuracy, the results are worse than non disambiguating at all.
    In his experimental setup, ambiguity is introduced artificially in t
