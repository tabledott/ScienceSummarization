cting their interactions.
  
  
    We have provided two ILP formulations for resolving coreference and demonstrated their superiority to a pairwise classifier that makes its coreference assignments greedily.
    In particular, we have also shown that ILP provides a natural means to express the use of both anaphoricity classification and coreference classification in a single system, and that doing so provides even further performance improvements, specifically f-score improvements of 5.3%, 4.9%, and 3.7% over the base coreference classifier on the ACE datasets.
    With ILP, it is not necessary to carefully control the anaphoricity threshold.
    This is in stark contrast to systems which use the anaphoricity classifier as a filter for the coreference classifier in a cascade setup.
    The ILP objective function incorporates the probabilities produced by both classifiers as weights on variables that indicate the ILP assignments for those tasks.
    The indicator variables associated with those assignments al
