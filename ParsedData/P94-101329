    The following table gives a breakdown of the different types of Spanish accent ambiguities, their relative frequency in the training corpus, and the algorithm's performance on each:1&#176; Summary of Performance on Spanish: As observed before, the prior probabilities in favor of the most common accent pattern are highly skewed, so one does reasonably well at this task by always using the most common pattern.
    But the error rate is still &amp;quot;The term prior is a measure of the baseline performance one would expect if the algorithm always chose the most common option. roughly 1 per every 75 words, which is unacceptably high.
    This algorithm reduces that error rate by over 65%.
    However, to get a better picture of the algorithm's performance, the following table gives a breakdown of results for a random set of the most problematic cases &#8212; words exhibiting the largest absolute number of the non-majority accent patterns.
    Collectively they constitute the most common pot
