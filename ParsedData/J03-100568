n compared to the fragment lengths for the translation direction German to English, hence the high CPU times.
    In an additional experiment for the translation direction French to English and the reordering constraint S3, we find we can speed up the translation time to about 18 seconds per sentence by using the following parameter setting: tc = 3.0, t, = 7.5, nc = 20, n, = 400, and no = 5.
    For the resulting hypotheses file, PER increases only slightly, from 51.4% to 51.6%.
    Translation examples for the translation direction French to English under the S3 reordering constraint are given in Table 17.
    The French input sentences show some preprocessing that is carried out beforehand to simplify the translation task (e.g., des is transformed into de les and l&#8217;est is transformed into le est).
    The translations produced are rather approximative in some cases, although the general meaning is often preserved.
