er that employs all the features. co/self-training oracle performance To avoid the issue of parameter selection for the co- and selftraining, we report their best possible oracle performance, which is the best F-measure number among all the co- and self-training parameter settings including the choice of the number of iterations. words, parts-of-speech (POS), character types, 4 characters at the beginning/ending in a 5-word window. words in a 3-syntactic chunk window. labels assigned to two words on the left. bi-grams of the current word and the label on the left. labels assigned to previous occurrences of the current word.
  
  
    We report named entity chunking performance on the CoNLL&#8217;03 shared-task3 corpora (English and German).
    We choose this task because the original intention of this shared task was to test the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning methods.
    However, it turned out that none of the top performing systems used unlabeled data.
    The likely reason is that the number of
