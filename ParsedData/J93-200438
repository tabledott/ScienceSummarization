 called permanent predictable ambiguities, allowing an annotator to indicate that a structure isglobally ambiguous even given the surrounding context (annotators always assign structure to a sentence on the basis of its context).
  An example of this use of pseudo-attachment is shown in Figure 5, where the participial phrase blown ashore 375 years ago modifies either warriors or boatload, but there is no way of settling the question--both attachments mean exactly the same thing.
  In the case at hand, the pseudo-attachment notation indicates that the annotator of the sentence thought hat VP-1 is most likely a modifier of warriors, but that it is also possible that it is a modifier of boatload.
  11A second use of pseudo-attachment is toallow annotators to represent the "underlying" position of extraposed elements; in addition to being attached in its superficial position in the tree, the extraposed constituent is pseudo- attached within the constituent to which it is semantically related.
