cy are not reliable even though the number of clues is relatively large.
    &#8220;Context&#8221; shows the coherency of the two types of context that we considered.
    The cp values are much higher than those in the &#8220;Window&#8221; methods, because the relationships between adjacent pairs of clauses are handled more appropriately by considering syntactic trees, adversative conjunctions, etc.
    The cp values for inter-sentential and intra-sentential contexts are almost the same, and thus both contexts can be used to obtain 2.5 times more clues for the intra-sentential context.
    In the rest of this paper we will use both contexts.
    We also observed the coherent precision for each domain corpus.
    The results in the center column of Table 5 indicate the number is slightly different among corpora, but all of them are far from perfect coherency.
    Besides the conflicting cases, there are many more cases where a polar clause does not appear in the polar context.
    We also observed the coherent
