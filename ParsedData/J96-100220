    2 It might be that the dual function W(A) does not achieve its maximum at any finite A*.
    In this case, the maximum entropy model will not have the form pA for any A.
    However, it will be the limit of models of this form, as indicated by the following result, whose proof we omit: The duality of maximum entropy and maximum likelihood is an example of the more general phenomenon of duality in constrained optimization. problem argmaxpEc H(p) argmaxx W (A) description maximum entropy maximum likelihood type of search constrained optimization unconstrained optimization search domain p E C real-valued vectors {Al, A2 &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;} solution A* Kuhn-Tucker theorem: p. = p),* For all but the most simple problems, the A* that maximize xi' (A) cannot be found analytically.
    Instead, we must resort to numerical methods.
    From the perspective of numerical optimization, the function 4f (A) is well behaved, since it is smooth and convex-11 in A. Consequently, a variety of numer
