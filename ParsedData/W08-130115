e river and right through the woods.
    Both prepositions, over and through, are governed by the verb went.
    To avoid disjoint subgraphs when collapsing the relations, examples like this are transformed into VP coordination, which requires making a copy of the word went.
    This gives the following representation, which corresponds to a sentence like Bill went over the river and went right through the woods: SD prep over(went-2, river-5) prep through(went-2&#8217;, woods-10) conj and(went-2, went-2&#8217;) Not collapsing the relations in such a case would prevent the alteration of the semantics, but would lead to a non-uniform treatment of prepositions.
    Uniformity is key for readability and user convenience.
    It seems therefore reasonable to use a representation which sacrifices the exact semantics of the original sentence by producing a sentence roughly equivalent, but which ensures uniformity across relations.
