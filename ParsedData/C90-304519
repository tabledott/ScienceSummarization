k, one of us noted that generation ac- cording to an augmented context-free grammar can be made more efficient by requiring the grammar to be se- mantically monotonic (Shieber, 1988); the derived se- mantics for an expression must include, in an appropri- ate sense, the semantic material of all its subconstituents.
			It is interesting to note that synchronous "FAGs are in- herently semantically monotonic.
			Furthermore, it is rea- sonable to require that the semantic omponent of a syn- chronous TAG t~ lexicalized (in the sense of Schabes et al.
			(1988)), allowing for more efficient parsing accord- ing to the semantic grammar and, consequenlly, more efficient generation.
			In the case of augmented context- free grammars, the semantic monotonicity requirement precludes "lexicalization" of the semantics.
			It is not possible to require nontrivial semantics to be associated with each lexical item.
			In summary, just as lexicaliza- lion of the syntactic grammar aids parsing (Schabes and Joshi, 1990), so lex
