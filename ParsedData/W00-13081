  An overview of these and other approaches can be found in Manning and Schiitze (1999, ch.
    10).
    However, all these methods use largely the same information sources for tagging, and often almost the same features as well, and as a consequence they also offer very similar levels of performance.
    This stands in contrast to the (manually-built) EngCG tagger, which achieves better performance by using lexical and contextual information sources and generalizations beyond those available to such statistical taggers, as Samuelsson and Voutilainen (1997) demonstrate. '
    We thank Dan Klein and Michael Saunders for useful discussions, and the anonymous reviewers for many helpful comments.
    This paper explores the notion that automatically built tagger performance can be further improved by expanding the knowledge sources available to the tagger.
    We pay special attention to unknown words, because the markedly lower accuracy on unknown word tagging means that this is an area where significant perform
