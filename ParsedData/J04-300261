er KNN classification.
    For the classification experiment, the data set OP1 was used in the preprocessing phase to select the value of k, and then classification was performed on the 1,222 documents in OP2.
    During training on OP1, k equal to 15 resulted in the best classification.
    On the test set, OP2, we achieved a classification accuracy of 0.939; the baseline accuracy for choosing the most frequent class (nonopinion pieces) was 0.915.
    Our classification accuracy represents a 28% reduction in error and is significantly better than baseline according to McNemar&#8217;s test (Everitt 1997).
    The positive results from the opinion piece classification show the usefulness of the various PSE features when used together.
  
  
    There has been much work in other fields, including linguistics, literary theory, psychology, philosophy, and content analysis, involving subjective language.
    As mentioned in Section 2, the conceptualization underlying our manual annotations is based on work in lite
