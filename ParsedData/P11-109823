iggers, we use the above definition to score a document with a template.
    A document is labeled with a template if it contains at least one trigger, and its average word probability is greater than a parameter optimized on the training set.
    A document can be (and often is) labeled with multiple templates.
    Finally, we label the sentences that contain triggers and use them for extraction in section 5.2.
    The MUC-4 corpus links templates to documents, allowing us to evaluate our document labels.
    We treat each link as a gold label (kidnap, bomb, or attack) for that document, and documents can have multiple labels.
    Our learned clusters naturally do not have MUC labels, so we report results on the four clusters that score highest with each label.
    Figure 4 shows the document classification scores.
    The bombing template performs best with an F1 score of .72.
    Arson occurs very few times, and Attack is lower because it is essentially an agglomeration of diverse events (discussed later).
