esponds to skipping a word, i.e. there is a word in the target string with no aligned word in the source string.
    The possible alignments using the monotonicity assumption are illustrated in Fig.
    1.
    Monotone alignments are paths through this uniform trellis structure.
    Using the concept of monotone alignments a search procedure can be formulated which is equivalent to finding the best path through a translation lattice, where the following auxiliary quantity is evaluated using dynamic programming: Here, e and e' are Qe, (j, e) probability of the best partial hypothesis (el, an with ei = e, = e' and a3 = i. the two final words of the hypothesized target string.
    The auxiliary quantity is evaluated in a position-synchronous way, where j is the processed position in the source string.
    The result of this search is a mapping: j (a3, ea,), where each source word is mapped to a target position a3 and a word ea, at this position.
    For a trigram language model the following DP recursion equatio
