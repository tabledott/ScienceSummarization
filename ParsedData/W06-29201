    Many thanks to Amit Dubey and Yuval Krymolowski, the other two organizers of the shared task, for discussions, converting treebanks, writing software and helping with the papers.2
  
  
    Previous CoNLL shared tasks focused on NP chunking (1999), general chunking (2000), clause identification (2001), named entity recognition (2002, 2003), and semantic role labeling (2004, 2005).
    This shared task on full (dependency) parsing is the logical next step.
    Parsing is an important preprocessing step for many NLP applications and therefore of considerable practical interest.
    It is a complex task and as it is not straightforwardly mappable to a &#8220;classical&#8221; segmentation, classification or sequence prediction problem, it also poses theoretical challenges to machine learning researchers.
    During the last decade, much research has been done on data-driven parsi
