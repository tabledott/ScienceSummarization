ng this leads to arbitrary order class-based n-gram models of the form: which we will call predictive class-based models in the following sections.
  
  
    One of the frequently used algorithms for automatically obtaining partitions of the vocabulary is the exchange algorithm (Kneser and Ney, 1993; Martin et al., 1998).
    Beginning with an initial clustering, the algorithm greedily maximizes the log likelihood of a two-sided class bigram or trigram model as described in Eq.
    (1) on the training data.
    Let V be the set of words in the vocabulary and C the set of classes.
    This then leads to the following optimization criterion, where N(w) and N(c) denote the number of occurrences of a word w or a class c in the training data and N(c, d) denotes the number of occurrences of some word in class c followed by a word in class d in the training data: The algorithm iterates over all words in the vocabulary and tentatively moves each word to each cluster.
    The change in the optimization criterion is co
