 of the triply-annotated subset yields further evidence of L-LDA&#8217;s advantage over SVM&#8217;s: 33 of the 51 were tag-page pairs where L-LDA&#8217;s output was picked by at least one annotator as a better snippet (although L-LDA might not have been picked by the other annotators).
    And of those, 24 were unanimous in that all three judges selected L-LDA&#8217;s output.
    By contrast, only 10 of the 51 were tag-page pairs where SVMs&#8217; output was picked by at least one annotator, and of those, only 2 were selected unanimously.
  
  
    In the preceding section we demonstrated how Labeled LDA&#8217;s credit attribution mechanism enabled effective modeling within documents.
    In this section, we consider whether L-LDA can be adapted as an effective multi-label classifier for documents as a whole.
    To answer that question, we applied a modified variant of L-LDA to a multi-label document classification problem: given a training set consisting of documents with multiple labels, predict the set of
