 effective use of the top-level sentences which occur in the signature context o&#8211;o.
    The classes found, as might be expected, range from clearly identifiable to nonsense.
    Note that simply directly clustering all sequences into 12 categories produced almost entirely the latter, with clusters representing various distituent types.
    Figure 9 shows several of the 12 classes.
    Class 0 is the model&#8217;s distituent class.
    Its most frequent members are a mix of obvious distituents (IN DT, DT JJ, IN DT, NN VBZ) and seemingly good sequences like NNP NNP.
    However, there are many sequences of 3 or more NNP tags in a row, and not all adjacent pairs can possibly be constituents at the same time.
    Class 1 is mainly common NP sequences, class 2 is proper NPs, class 3 is NPs which involve numbers, and class 6 is N sequences, which tend to be linguistically right but unmarked in the treebank.
    Class 4 is a mix of seemingly good NPs, often from positions like VBZ&#8211;NN where they were not
