re obtained by combining the modified sentences in L1 with the original sentences in L2 and L3, and projecting to the multilingual pairs the annotations assigned to the monolingual pairs.
    In principle, only two stages of the process require crowdsourcing multilingual tasks, but do not concern entailment annotations.
    The first one, at the beginning of the process, aims to obtain a set of parallel sentences to start with, and can be done in different ways (e.g. crowdsourcing the translation of a set of sentences).
    The second one, at the end of the process, consists of translating the modified L1 sentences into other languages (e.g.
    L2) in order to extend the corpus to cover new language combina9With the positive examples drawn from bidirectional and unidirectional entailments from T to H, and the negative ones drawn from unidirectional entailments from H to T. The main steps of our corpus creation process, depicted in Figure 1, can be summarized as follows: Step1: Sentence modification.
