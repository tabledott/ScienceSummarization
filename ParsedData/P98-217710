d these approximations is that when generating p given a noun (verb) attachment, only the counts involving the noun (verb) are relevant, assuming also that the noun (verb) has an attached prepositional phrase, i.e., 0 = true.
    We use word statistics from both the tagged corpus and the set of extracted head word tuples to estimate the probability of generating 0 = true, p, and n2.
    Counts from the extracted set of tuples assume that 0 = true, while counts from the corpus itself may correspond to either 0 = true or 0 = false, depending on if the noun if p = of otherwise or verb in question is, or is not, respectively, unambiguously attached to a preposition.
    The quantities Pr(trueln) and Pr(truelv) denote the conditional probability that n or v will occur with some unambiguously attached preposition, and are estimated as follows: p, and define cN Ep cAp) as the number of noun attached tuples.
    Analogously, define cv(p) = E, c(v, p, true) and cv = Ep cv (P)&#8226; The counts c(n,p,true) and c(v,p,tr
