 consisted of published, edited text, we assumed that this material contained few, if any, errors.
    In this and subsequent tests, the model was used to classify each context as one of 34 classes (prepositions).
    Results of the comparison between the classifier and the test set showed that the overall proportion of agreement between the text and the classifier was 0.69.
    The value of kappa was 0.64.
    When we examined the errors, we discovered that, frequently, the classifier&#8217;s most probable preposition (the one it assigned) differed from the second most probable by just a few percentage points.
    This corresponded to a situation in which two or more prepositions were likely to be found in a given context.
    Consider the context They thanked him for his consideration this matter, where either of or in could fill the blank.
    Because the classifier was forced to make a choice in this and other close cases, it incurred a high probability of making an error.
    To avoid this situation, we
