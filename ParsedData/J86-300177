on is the true interruption, which follows the strong definition of interruptions.
    It is exemplified by the interruption given in the previous subsection.
    Discourses D1 and D2 have distinct, unrelated purposes and convey different information about properties, objects, and relations.
    Since D2 occurs within D1, one expects the discourse structures for the two segments to be somehow embedded as well.
    The theory described in this paper differs from Polanyi and Scha's (1984; and other more radically different proposals as well; e.g., Linde and Goguen 1978, Cohen 1983, Reichman-Adar 1984) because the &amp;quot;embedding&amp;quot; occurs only in the attentional structure.
    As shown in Figure 8, the focus space for D2 is pushed onto the stack above the focus space for D1, so that the focus space for D2 is more salient than the one for D1, until D2 is completed.
    The intentional structures for the two segments are distinct.
    There are two DP/DSP structures for the utterances in this sequence
