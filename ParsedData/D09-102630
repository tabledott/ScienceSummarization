frequency over tf-idf weighting based on 4-fold cross-validation on 3,000 documents drawn from an independent permutation of the data.
    For L-LDA, we tuned the shared parameters of threshold and proportionality constants in word and topic priors.
    L-LDA and SVM have very similar performance on MacroF1, while L-LDA substantially outperforms on MicroF1.
    In both cases, L-LDA&#8217;s improvement is statistically significantly by a 2-tailed paired t-test at 95% confidence. multi-label text classification for predicting 20 tags on del.icio.us data.
    L-LDA outperforms SVMs significantly on both metrics by a 2-tailed, paired t-test at 95% confidence.
  
  
    One of the main advantages of L-LDA on multiply labeled documents comes from the model&#8217;s document-specific topic mixture &#952;.
    By explicitly modeling the importance of each label in the document, Labeled LDA can effective perform some contextual word sense disambiguation, which suggests why L-LDA can outperform SVMs on the del.icio.us d
