o three pounds of carrots, for example, is that shown in figure 1.
  A knowledge base entity models a physobj in a particular state.
  An entity may change during the course of a recipe, as processes are applied to it: in particular, apart from gaining new properties such as being peeled, chopped, etc., an ingredients structure may change, for example, from set to mass.
  Each such change of state results in the creation of a new knowledge base entity.
  Suppose, for example, a grating event is applied to our three pounds of carrots between states so and sl: the entity shown in figure i will then become a mass of grated carrot, represented in state sl by the KBE shown in figure 2.
  BUILDING A REFERRING EXPRESS ION To construct a referring expression corresponding to a knowledge base entity, we first build a deep se- 68 KBE -~ indus = ZO state = so structure = set quantity = [ num~erUnit = pound= 3 ] speC = structure = indiv idual substance = carrot - , - -  [ ] packaging = ehape= carrot ?
