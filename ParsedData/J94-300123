    A nondeterministic (one-tape) finite-state machine is a quintuple (E,Q,q,F,6), where E is a finite alphabet, Q is a finite set of states, q e Q is the initial state, and F c Q is the set of final states.
    The transition function 6 is a total function that maps Q x E' to 2, the set of all subsets of Q, and every state s in Q is vacuously a member of 6(s, &#8364;).
    We extend the function 6 to sets of states, so that for any P C Q and a E E', 6(P, a) = Up 6(p, a).
    We also define the usual extension of 6 to a transition function 6* on E* as follows: for all r in Q, 6*(r,E) = 6(r, e) and for all u c E* and a E E6, 6*(r , ua) = 6(6* (r , u), a).
    Thus, the machine accepts a string x just in case 6*(q , x) n F is nonempty; that is, if there is a sequence of transitions over x beginning at the initial state and ending at a set of states at least one of which is final.
    We know, of course, that every regular language is also accepted by a deterministic, &amp;free finite-state machine, but as
