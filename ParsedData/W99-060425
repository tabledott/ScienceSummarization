case.
    In principal, when re-ordering words of the source string, words of the German verb group could be moved over punctuation marks, although it was penalized by a constant cost.
    The WER is computed as the minimum number of substitution, insertion and deletion operations that have to be performed to convert the generated string into the target string.
    This performance criterion is widely used in speech recognition.
    A shortcoming of the WER is the fact that it requires a perfect word order.
    This is Table 2: Experiments for Text and Speech Input: Word error rate (WER), positionindependent word error rate (PER) and subjective sentence error rate (SSER) with/without preprocessing (147 sentences = 1 968 words of the Verbmobil task). particularly a problem for the Verbmobil task, where the word order of the GermanEnglish sentence pair can be quite different.
    As a result, the word order of the automatically generated target sentence can be different from that of the target sentence, but nev
