e future, as hardware im proves, this will become less of an issue, but there may be ways to improve the algorithm, so that a smaller corpus is sufficient.Another area for future work is to apply Pair Class to more tasks.
			WordNet includes more thana dozen semantic relations (e.g., synonyms, hy ponyms, hypernyms, meronyms, holonyms, and antonyms).
			PairClass should be applicable to allof these relations.
			Other potential applications in clude any task that involves semantic relations, such as word sense disambiguation, informationretrieval, information extraction, and metaphor in terpretation.
	
	
			In this paper, we have described a uniform approach to analogies, synonyms, antonyms, and as sociations, in which all of these phenomena are subsumed by analogies.
			We view the problem ofrecognizing analogies as the classification of se mantic relations between words.
			We believe that most of our lexical knowledge is relational, not attributional.
			That is, meaning is largely about relations among wor
