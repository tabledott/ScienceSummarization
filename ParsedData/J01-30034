, or lexical-semantic verb classes such as those proposed by Levin (1993) (Aone and McKee 1996; McCarthy 2000; Lapata and Brew 1999; Schulte im Walde 2000).
    In this paper, we focus on argument structure&#8212;the thematic roles assigned by a verb to its arguments&#8212;as the way in which the relational semantics of the verb is represented at the syntactic level.
    Specifically, our proposal is to automatically classify verbs based on argument structure properties, using statistical corpus-based methods.
    We address the problem of classification because it provides a means for lexical organization which can effectively capture generalizations over verbs (Palmer 2000).
    Within the context of classification, the use of argument structure provides a finer discrimination among verbs than that induced by subcategorization frames (as we see below in our example classes, which allow the same subcategorizations but differ in thematic assignment), but a coarser classification than that proposed by Levin (i
