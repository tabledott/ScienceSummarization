    If we generate twelve trees at random from qi, it would not be too surprising if we got the corpus in Figure 3.
    More extremely, if we generate a random corpus of size 1 from qi, it is quite impossible for the resulting empirical distribution to match the distribution qi.
    But as the corpus size increases, the fit between 15 and qi becomes ever better.
  
  
    But what if the dependency in corpus (3) is not accidental?
    What if we wish to adopt a grammar that imposes the constraint that both A's rewrite the same way?
    We can impose such a constraint by means of an attribute-value grammar.
    We may formalize an attribute-value grammar as a context-free grammar with attribute labels and path equations.
    An example is the following grammar; let us call it G2: Generating a dag.
    The grammar used is G2. node labeled with the start category of G2, namely, S. A node x is expanded by choosing a rule that rewrites the category of x.
    In this case, we choose rule 1 to expand the root nod
