, in decreasing order of importance, are log likelihood of discourse relations, number of discourse relations, N-O transitions, O-N transitions, average number of VPs per sentence and text probability under a general language model.
    In terms of classes of features, the 16 entity grid features perform the best, leading to an accuracy of 79.41%, followed by the combination of the four discourse features (77.36%), and syntax features (74.07%).
    This is evidence for the fact that there is a complex interplay between readability factors: the entity grid factors which individually have very weak correlation with readability combine well, while adding the three additional discourse features to the likelihood of discourses relations actually worsens performance slightly.
    Similar indication for interplay between features is provided by the class ablation classification results, in which classes of features are removed.
    Surprisingly, removing syntactic features causes the biggest deterioration in perform
