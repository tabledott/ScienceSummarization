-base construction.
    The TroFi Example Base is available at http://www.cs.sfu.ca/&#732;anoop/students/jbirke/.
    Further unsupervised expansion of the existing clusters as well as the production of additional clusters is a possibility.
  
  
    In this paper we presented TroFi, a system for separating literal and nonliteral usages of verbs through statistical word-sense disambiguation and clustering techniques.
    We suggest that TroFi is applicable to all sorts of nonliteral language, and that, although it is currently focused on English verbs, it could be adapted to other parts of speech and other languages.
    We adapted an existing word-sense disambiguation algorithm to literal/nonliteral clustering through the redefinition of literal and nonliteral as word senses, the alteration of the similarity scores used, and the addition of learners and voting, SuperTags, and additional context.
    For all our models and algorithms, we carried out detailed experiments on hand-annotated data, both to fully e
