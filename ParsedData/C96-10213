			In addition to extremely high levels of accuracy in recall and precision of tag assignment ((VoutiJainen et al, 1992) report 99.77?/,, overall recall and 95.54% overall preciskm, over a variety of text genres, and in comparison with other state-of-the-art tagging sys- tems), the primary motivation for adopting this system is the requirement todevelop a robust ext processor- with anaphora resolution being just one of its discourse analysis functkms capable of reliably handling arbi- trary kinds of input.
			The tagger provides a very simple analysis of the structure of the text: for each lexical item in each sen- tence, it provides a set of values which indicate the morphological, lexical, grammatical nd syntactic fea- tures of the item in tile context in which it appears.
