at BLEU goes up as the fraction approaches between 20% and 30%.
			This seems to be a relatively stable observation across the experiments.
			It is also easily explained by its strong relationship to pruning threshold.
			4.3 Large corpora.
			Table 6 shows that this is not just a small corpus phenomenon.
			There is a sizeable benefit both in phrase table reduction and a modest improvement to BLEU even in this case.
			4.4 Is this just the same as phrasetable.
			smoothing?
			One question that occurred early on was whether this improvement in BLEU is somehow related to the improvement in BLEU that occurs with phrasetable smoothing.
			972It appears that the answer is, in the main, yes, al though there is definitely something else going on.It is true that the benefit in terms of BLEU is less ened for better types of phrasetable smoothing but the benefit in terms of the reduction in bulk holds.
			It is reassuring to see that no harm to BLEU is done by removing even 80% of the phrasetable.
