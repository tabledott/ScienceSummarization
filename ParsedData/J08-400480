 tasks.
    For example, it assumes that units may not overlap in a single coder&#8217;s output, yet in practice there are many The difference between overlapping units is d(A, B) = s2&#8722; + s2+ (adapted from Krippendorff 1995, Figure 4, page 61). annotation schemes which require coders to label nested syntactic constituents.
    For continuous segmentation tasks, &#945;U may be inappropriate because when a segment identified by one annotator overlaps with two segments identified by another annotator, the distance is smallest when the one segment is centered over the two rather than aligned with one of them.
    Nevertheless, we feel that when the non-overlap assumption holds, and the units do not cover the text exhaustively, testing the reliabilty of unit identification may prove beneficial.
    To our knowledge, this has never been tested in CL.
    The annotation tasks discussed so far involve assigning a specific label to each category, which allows the various agreement measures to be applied in a str
