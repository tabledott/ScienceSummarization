of a better language model, it has also been ar- gued that the phenomena that such devices cannot cap- ture occur relatively infrequently.
			Such argumentation is linguistically not sound.
			Lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars (LTAG) t com- bine hierarchical structures while being hxieany sensi- tive and are therefore more appropriate for statistical analysis of language.
			In fact, LTAGs are the simplest hierarchical formalism which can serve as the basis for lexicalizing context-free grammar (Schabes, 1990; Joshi and Sehabes, 1991).
			LTAG is a tree-rewriting system that combines trees of large domain with adjoining and substitution.
			The trees found in a TAG take advantage of the available x- tended domain of locality by localizing syntactic depen- dencies (such as finer-gap, subject-verb, verb-objeet) and most semantic dependencies ( uch as predicate- argument relationship).
			For example, the following trees can be found in a LTAG lexicon: S /k NP,L VIP VP A V NPI NP NP VP* ADV L I I I uts J~n p~n
