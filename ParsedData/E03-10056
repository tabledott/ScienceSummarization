 task, the parsing time was reported to be over 200 seconds per sentence (Bod 2003).
    Collins &amp; Duffy (2002) showed how the perceptron algorithm can be used to efficiently compute the best parse with DOP1's subtrees, reporting a 5.1% relative reduction in error rate over the model in Collins (1999) on the WSJ.
    Goodman (2002) furthermore showed how Bonnema et al. 's (1999) and Bod's (2001) estimators can be incorporated in his PCFGreduction, but did not report any experiments with these reductions.
    This paper presents the first published results with Goodman's PCFG-reductions of both Bonnema et al. 's (1999) and Bod's (2001) estimators on the WSJ.
    We show that these PCFG-reductions result in a 60 times speedup in processing time w.r.t.
    Bod (2001, 2003).
    But while Bod's estimator obtains state-of-the-art results on the WSJ, comparable to Charniak (2000) and Collins (2000), Bonnema et al. 's estimator performs worse and is comparable to Collins (1996).
