tion needed to compute a unique interpretation for an utterance is not always available at the time the utterance occurs in the discourse, the ways in which a theory treats partial information affects its computational tractability as the basis for discourse interpretation.
    It is not merely that utterances themselves contain only partial information, but that it may only be subsequent to an utterance that sufficient information is available for computing a unique interpretation.
    No matter how rich a model of context one has, it will not be possible to fully constrain the interpretation of an utterance when it occurs.
    This is especially true for definite noun phrase interpretation.
    For example, several interpretations are possible for the noun phrase &amp;quot;the Vice-President of the United States,&amp;quot; in the utterance (21) The Vice-President of the United States is also President of the Senate.
