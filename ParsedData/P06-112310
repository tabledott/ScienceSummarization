r sentence was longer than 100 words.
    Table 1 gives descriptive statistics for the remaining data.
    The table also shows the upper bound of the 95% confidence intervals for the coverage rates reported later.
    The results of experiments on different bitexts are not directly comparable, due to the varying genres and sentence lengths.
    One of the main independent variables in our experiments was the number of monolingual parse trees used to constrain the hierarchical alignments.
    To induce models of translational equivalence, some researchers have tried to use such trees to constrain bilingual constituents: The span of every node in the constraining parse tree must coincide with the relevant monolingual span of some node in the bilingual derivation tree.
    These additional constraints can thwart attempts at hierarchical alignment that might have succeeded otherwise.
    Figure 2a shows a word alignment and a parse tree that can be hierarchically aligned without gaps.
