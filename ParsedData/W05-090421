entences from bad.
    Indeed, in some recent work on re-ranking machine translation hypotheses (Och et al., 2004), parserproduced structures were not found to provide helpful information, as a parser is likely to assign a goodlooking structure to even a lousy input hypothesis.
    However, there is an important distinction between the use of parsers in re-ranking and evaluation &#8211; in the present work we are looking for similarities between pairs of parse trees rather than at features of a single tree.
    This means that the syntax-based evaluation measures can succeed even when the tree structure for a poor hypothesis looks reasonable on its own, as long as it is sufficiently distinct from the structures used in the references.
    We speculate that by discriminatively training weights for the individual subtrees and headword chains used by the syntax-based metrics, further improvements in evaluation accuracy are possible.
