The usability of t depends on paraphrase units it contains.
    Hence the usability model where &#955;um is the weight for the usability model and pum(&#175;si, &#175;ti) is defined as follows: We consider three applications, including sentence compression, simplification, and similarity computation. &#181;(&#175;si, &#175;ti) is defined separately for each: only the target units that can enhance the similarity to the reference sentence are kept in planning.
    We define &#181;(si, ti) = sim(&#65533;ti, s')&#8722; sim(si, s'), where sim(&#183;, &#183;) is simply computed as the count of overlapping words.
    We combine the three sub-models based on a log-linear framework and get the SPG model: We use five PTs in this work (except the selfparaphrase table), in which each pair of paraphrase units has a score assigned by the score function of the corresponding method.
    Paraphrase phrases (PT-1 to PT-3): Paraphrase phrases are extracted from three corpora: lel translations of the same foreign novel).
