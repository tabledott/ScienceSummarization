ision and have very low variance.
    Both recall and precision have a relatively high variance.
    Cue words (e.g., &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;) are words that are sometimes used to explicitly signal the structure of a discourse.
    We develop a 19seline segmentation algorithm based on cue words, using a simplification of one of the features shown by Hirschberg and Litman (1993) to identify discourse usages of cue words.
    Hirschberg and Litman (1993) examine a large set of cue words proposed in the literature and show that certain prosodic and structural features, including a position of first in prosodic phrase, are highly correlated with the discourse uses of these words.
    The input to our lower bound cue word algorithm is a sequential list of the prosodic phrases constituting a given narrative, the same input our subjects received.
    The output is a set of boundaries B, represented as ordered pairs of adjacent phrases (Fn,Pn+i), such that the first item in Pn+i is a member of the set of cue words su
