tion in a generative framework that describes how the contexts surrounding an ambiguous word might be generated on the basis of latent variables.
    Our model incorporates features based on lexical information, parts of speech, and dependencies in a principled manner, and outperforms state-of-theart systems.
    Crucially, the approach is not specific to the sense induction task and can be adapted for other applications where it is desirable to take multiple levels of information into account.
    For example, in document classification, one could consider an accompanying image and its caption as possible additional layers to the main text.
    In the future, we hope to explore more rigorous parameter estimation techniques.
    Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) describe a method for integrating hyperparameter estimation into the Gibbs sampling procedure using a prior over possible values.
    Such an approach could be adopted in our framework, as well, and extended to include the layer weighting parameters, whi
