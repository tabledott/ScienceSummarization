ng if a term is Subjective is itself non-trivial.
    In this paper we confront the task of determining whether a given term has a Positive connotation (e.g. honest, intrepid), or a Negative connotation (e.g. disturbing, superfluous), or has instead no Subjective connotation at all (e.g. white, triangular); this problem thus subsumes the problem of deciding between Subjective and Objective and the problem of deciding between Positive and Negative.
    We tackle this problem by testing three different variants of the semi-supervised method for orientation detection proposed in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005).
    Our results show that determining subjectivity and orientation is a much harder problem than determining orientation alone.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
    Section 2 reviews related work dealing with term orientation and/or subjectivity detection.
    Section 3 briefly reviews the semi-supervised method for orientation detection presented in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005).
