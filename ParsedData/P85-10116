  Pact (b) is implicit im that paper, but it is impor*ut  to state it explicitly as we have done here because of it8 linguistic significance.

  We will now illustrate p,1~ (b) and (e).
  Example 2.2: Let G J (I,A) where !

  adjoined at T as indicated in ~.. Clearly.
  L(G), the string language of G is L-- { , .eb .
  / Q&gt;o } which is a context-free language.
  Thus, there must exist a context- tree grammar, G, which is at least we~tkly equivalent to G. [t cam be shown however that there is no context.flee grammar G which is strongly equivalent to G, i.e., T(G) I-  T(G).
  This follows from the fa t  that the set T(G) (the tree ~et of G) is non-r~o,~nizable.
