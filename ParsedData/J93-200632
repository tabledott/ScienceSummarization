    The fact that so little data was adequate deserves further scrutiny.
    The grammar had approximately 1,050 rules, one third of which are lexical, e.g., a category goes to a word.
    Estimating the lexical level is best handled via the part-of-speech techniques covered in the previous section.
    Therefore, there were 700 nonlexical rules.
    The training corpus consisted of 81 sentences whose parses averaged approximately 35 rules per sentence.
    Therefore, the corpus of trees included approximately 2,850 rule occurrences, or about 4 per rule on average over all rules.
    However, as few as half of the rules were actually employed, leading to an average of roughly 8 rule occurrences per rule observed.
    Therefore, there was close to the amount of data one would predict as desirable.
    One further note about counting rule occurrences in the unification grammar.
    Rather than counting different unification bindings as different rules, we counted the rule with unbound variables, rep
