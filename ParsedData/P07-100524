t is statistically significant.
    We have also demonstrated one way to integrate a WSD system into an MT system without introducing any rules that compete against existing rules, and where the feature-weight tuning and decoding place the WSD system on an equal footing with the other model components.
    For future work, an immediate step would be for the WSD classifier to provide translations for longer Chinese phrases.
    Also, different alternatives could be tried to match the translations provided by the WSD classifier against the chunks of rules.
    Finally, besides our proposed approach of integrating WSD into statistical MT via the introduction of two new features, we could explore other alternative ways of integration.
