g with medium frequency.
    We then ran Champollion on each of these sets, using three separate database corpora of varying size, also taken from the Hansards corpus.
    We asked several people fluent in both French and English to judge the results, and the accuracy of Champollion was found to range from 65% to 78%.
    In our discussion of results, we show how problems for the lower score can be alleviated by increasing the size of the database corpus.
    In the following sections, we first present a review of related work in statistical natural language processing dealing with bilingual data.
    Our algorithm depends on using a measure of correlation to find words that are highly correlated across languages.
    We describe the measure that we use and then provide a detailed description of the algorithm, following this with a theoretical analysis of the performance of our algorithm.
    Next, we turn to a description of the results and evaluation.
    Finally, we show how the results can be used for a v
