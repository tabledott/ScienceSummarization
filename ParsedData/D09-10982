 (automatic set expansion).
    We provide a detailed empirical analysis of the discovered named entities and quantify the effect on expansion accuracy of corpus size, corpus quality, seed composition, and seed set size.
  
  
    Below we review relevant work in optimizing similarity computations and automatic set expansion.
    The distributional hypothesis (Harris 1954), which links the meaning of words to their contexts, has inspired many algorithms for computing term similarities (Lund and Burgess 1996; Lin 1998; Lee 1999; Erk and Pad&#243; 2008; Agirre et al. 2009).
    Brute force similarity computation compares all the contexts for each pair of terms, with complexity O(n2m) where n is the number of terms and m is the number of possible contexts.
    More efficient strategies are of three kinds: Smoothing: Techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis reduce the context space by applying truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Deerwester et al. 1990).
    Computing the matrix decomposition however
