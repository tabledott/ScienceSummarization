s of a SLTAG, the algorithm re-estimates these parameters on the basis of the parses of each sentence in a training corpus obtained by a CKY-tyt)e parser.
			The algorithm is designed to derive a new estimate after each iteration such that the probability of the corpus is increased or equivalently such that tile cross entropy estimate (negative log probability) is decreased: log~(e(r0)) l t (W,G) - weW (15) wEW In order to derive a new estimate, the algorithm needs to compute for all seutences in W the in- side probabilities and the outside probabilities.
			Given a string w = al . . .aN, tbe outside probability, 0 ~ (pos, ~, i, j, k, It, is defined for all nodes r I contained in an elementary tree a and for pos E {t,b}, and for all indices 0 &lt; i &lt; j &lt; k &lt; l &lt; N as follows: (it If the node r/does not subsume the foot node of a (if there is one), then j and k axe un- bound asld: ..de\] O'?
