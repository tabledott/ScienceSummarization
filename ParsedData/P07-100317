ate in the next section: Syntax-alignment compatibility can be further promoted with a simple posterior decoding heuristic we call competitive thresholding.
    Given a threshold and a matrix c of combined weights for each possible link in an alignment, we include a link (i, j) only if its weight cij is above-threshold and it is connected to the maximum weighted link in both row i and column j.
    That is, only the maximum in each column and row and a contiguous enclosing span of above-threshold links are included in the alignment.
  
  
    This proposed model is not the first variant of the HMM model that incorporates syntax-based distortion.
    Lopez and Resnik (2005) considers a simpler tree distance distortion model.
    Daum&#180;e III and Marcu (2005) employs a syntax-aware distortion model for aligning summaries to documents, but condition upon the roots of the constituents that are jumped over during a transition, instead of those that are visited during a walk through the tree.
    In the case of
