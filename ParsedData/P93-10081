ecognizer.
    On the other hand, a system should be able to detect that a recognized string is not a sentence of English, to help filter recognition errors by the speech recognizer.
    Furthermore, if parsing and recognition are interleaved, then the parser should enforce constraints on partial utterances.
    The approach taken in Gemini is to constrain language recognition with fairly conventional grammar, but to augment that grammar with two orthogonal rule-based recognition modules, one for glueing together the fragments found during the conventional grammar parsing phase, and another for recognizing and eliminating disfluencies known as &amp;quot;repairs.&amp;quot; At the same time, *This research was supported by the Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract ONR N0001490-C-0085 with the Office of Naval Research.
