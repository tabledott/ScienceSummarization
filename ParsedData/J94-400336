    The largest value of 13, occurs for the tuple (verb&#8212;obj: higdil sikkuy), for which higdil can be translated to 'increase,' magnify,' or 'enlarge.'
    The first alternative appeared n1 =- 20 times, and the other alternatives did not appear at all, (n2 = n3 = 0).
    Adding the correction factor and computing Ba yields Ba(ni + 0.5, n2 + 0.5) = Ba (20.5, 0.5) = 1.879 &gt; 0.2 = 0.
    Therefore, the word 'increase' was chosen as the translation of higdil.
    Since this word appears also in the tuple (subj&#8212;verb: hitztarrfut higdil), the target tuples that include alternative translations of higdil were deleted.
    Thus were deleted.
    This leaves us with only one alternative (subj&#8212;verb: joining increase) as a possible translation of this Hebrew tuple, which is therefore removed from the input list.
    We now recompute the values of Ba for the remaining tuples.
    The maximal value is obtained for the tuple where Ba (29,5) = 1.137&gt; 0.
    We, therefore, choose the word 'progress' as
