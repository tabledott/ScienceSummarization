    In DUC, &#223; is set to a very big number (?

    Therefore, only Rlcs is considered.
    We call the LCS-based F-measure, i.e.
    Equation 4, ROUGE-L. Notice that ROUGE-L is 1 when X = Y; while ROUGE-L is zero when LCS(X,Y) = 0, i.e. there is nothing in common between X and Y. Fmeasure or its equivalents has been shown to have met several theoretical criteria in measuring accuracy involving more than one factor (Van Rijsbergen, 1979).
    The composite factors are LCS-based recall and precision in this case.
    Melamed et al. (2003) used unigram F-measure to estimate machine translation quality and showed that unigram Fmeasure was as good as BLEU.
    One advantage of using LCS is that it does not require consecutive matches but in-sequence matches that reflect sentence level word order as n-grams.
    The other advantage is that it automatically includes longest in-sequence common n-grams, therefore no predefined n-gram length is necessary.
    ROUGE-L as defined in Equation 4 has the prope
