  Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation Rivaling Supervised Methods
  
    This paper presents an unsupervised learning algorithm for sense disambiguation that, when trained on unannotated English text, rivals the performance of supervised techniques that require time-consuming hand annotations.
    The algorithm is based on two powerful constraints &#8212; that words tend to have one sense per discourse and one sense per collocation &#8212; exploited in an iterative bootstrapping procedure.
    Tested accuracy exceeds 96%.
  
  
    This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm that can accurately disambiguate word senses in a large, completely untagged corpus.1 The algorithm avoids the need for costly hand-tagged training data by exploiting two powerful properties of human language: Moreover, language is highly redundant, so that the sense of a word is effectively overdetermined by (1) and (2) above.
    The algorithm uses these properties to incrementally identify collocations for target senses of a word
