oot of the sub-tree ~ gives us the senteutiaJ tree in Fig 5.1.
  We eros, now see how the string whx has ?
  wrapped around* the sub-tree i.e,the string ugv.
  This seems to suggest that there is something similiar m the role played by the foot in an auxilliary tree and the head in a Head Grammar how the adjoining operations and head-wrapping operations operate on strings.
  We could say that if X is the root of ~ auxilliary tree t~ and al...x i X a~+t...a ~ is the frontier o( a derived tree ~ E D(~}, then the derivation of 7 would correspond to a derivation from a non-terminal X to the string al...a 4 1ai?t...a~ in HG and the use of 7 in some senteutial tree would correspond to how the strings al... a 5 and ~?t...a~ are used in deriving, string in HL.

  It is more convin/ent for us to think of the headed string (i,at.
