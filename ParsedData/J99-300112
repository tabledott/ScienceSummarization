ally, a recap of Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein [1995]) in Section 3, we turn in Section 4 to our approach, the functional model of centering.
    In Section 5, we present the methodological framework and the empirical data from two evaluation studies we carried out.
    In Section 6, we relate our work to alternative approaches dealing with local text coherence.
    In Section 7, we discuss some remaining unsolved problems.
