 information retrieval, such as the dot product, with each word weighted by their TF-IDF value.
    Syntactic features are computed based on a syntactic parse tree.
    Ge et al. (1998) implement a Hobbs distance feature, which encodes the rank assigned to a candidate antecedent for a pronoun by Hobbs&#8217;s (1978) seminal syntax-based pronoun resolution algorithm.
    Luo and Zitouni (2005) extract features from a parse tree for implementing Binding Constraints (Chomsky, 1988).
    Given an automatically parsed corpus, Bergsma and Lin (2006) extract from each parse tree a dependency path, which is represented as a sequence of nodes and dependency labels connecting a pronoun and a candidate antecedent, and collect statistical information from these paths to determine the likelihood that a pronoun and a candidate antecedent connected by a given path are coreferent.
    Rather than deriving features from parse trees, Iida et al. (2006) and Yang et al.
    (2006) employ these trees directly as structured featur
