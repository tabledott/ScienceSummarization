; is about 20-25% relative.
    Overall, automatic capitalization error rate 1.4%is achieved on BN data.
  
  
    Automatic capitalization is a practically relevant problem: speech recognition output needs to be capitalized; also, modern word processors perform capitalization among other text proofing algorithms such as spelling correction and grammar checking.
    Capitalization can be also used as a preprocessing step in named entity extraction or machine translation.
    We study the impact of using increasing amounts of training data as well as using a small amount of adaptation data on this simple problem that is well suited to data-driven approaches since vast amounts of &#8220;training&#8221; data are easily obtainable by simply wiping the case information in text.
    As in previous approaches, the problem is framed as an instance of the class of sequence labeling problems.
    A case frequently encountered in practice is that of using mismatched &#8212; out-of-domain, in this particular case we used
