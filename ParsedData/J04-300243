uster size n from 2 through 40, and precision threshold T from 0.01 through 0.70 by .03).
    As mentioned above, each (n, T) parameter pair yields a set of adjectives RT,n, that is, the union of all sets {si} U Ci,n with precision on the training set &gt; T. A subset, ADJpses, of those sets is chosen based on precision and frequency in a validation set.
    Finally, the ADJpses are tested on the test set.
    Table 7 shows the results for four opinion piece test sets.
    Multiple trainingvalidation data set pairs are used for each test set, as given in Table 7.
    The results are for the union of the adjectives (verbs) chosen for each pair.
    The freq columns give total frequencies, and the +prec columns show the improvements in precision from the baseline.
    For each data set, the difference between the proportion of instances of ADJpses in opinion pieces and the proportion in nonopinion pieces is significant (p &lt; 0.001, z &gt; 9.2).
    The same is true for VERBpses (p &lt; 0.001, z &gt; 4.1).
