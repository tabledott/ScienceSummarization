 theory approaches the problem of linguistic description axiomatically, and many current formalisms in use in natural-language processing, especially the logic grammar and unification-based for- malisms follow this approach as well.
  Consequently, the results pre- sented here will, for the most part, be applicable to any of these formalisms.
  We will, however, describe the system schematically-- without relying on any of the particular formalisms, but using notation that schematizes an augmented context-free formalism like definite- clause grammars or PATR.
  We merely assume that grammars classify phrases under a possibly infinite set of structured objects, as is com- mon in the unification-based formalisms.
  These structures--terms in definite-clause grammars, directed graphs in PATt~, and so forth--will be referred to generically as nonterminais, ince they play the role in the augmented context-free formalisms that the atomic nonterminal symbols fulfill in standard context-free grammars.
  We will assum
