    The final evaluation was done on the remaining 560 examples.
    Timing results are reported in seconds of CPU time7.
    POS tagging of the input to the Collins parser took 6 seconds and this was added to the timing result of the Collins parser.
    Time spent for finite-state morphology and dictionary lookup for XLE is part of the measure of its timing performance.
    We did not include the time for dependency extraction or stemming the Collins output.
    Table 1 shows timing and accuracy results for the Reduced dependency set.
    The parser settings compared are Model 3 of the Collins parser adjusted to beam size 1000, and the Core and Complete versions of the XLE system, differing in the size of the grammar&#8217;s constraintset.
    Clearly, both versions of the XLE system achieve a significant reduction in error rate over the Collins parser (12% for the core XLE system and 20% for the complete system) at an increase in parsing time of a factor of only 1.49 for the core XLE system.
