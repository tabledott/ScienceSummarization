, el. and the differences are, in any case, not germane to our current concerns.
    The initial agenda, including active edges, and collecting edges by the vertices that they are incident from, is given in (16).
    The grammar is consulted only for the purpose of creating active edges and all interactions in the chart are between active and inactive pairs of edges incident from the same vertex.
