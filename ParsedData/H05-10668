			It is clear that dependency trees for x and spanning trees for Gx co incide, since both kinds of trees are required to be rooted at the dummy root and reach all the wordsin the sentence.
			Hence, finding a (projective) depen dency tree with highest score is equivalent to finding a maximum (projective) spanning tree in Gx.
