-3 (Bidirectional Entailment).
    As a result 1,438 new pairs were created; out of these, 148 resulted to be bidirectional entailments and were stored in the corpus.
    Finally, the 1,298 entailment pairs judged as nonbidirectional in the two previously completed HIT3 (8+1,290) were given as input to HIT-5 (Unidirectional Entailment).
    The pairs which passed the agreement threshold were classified according to the judgement received, and stored in the corpus as unidirectional entailment pairs.
    The analysis of Table 1 allows to formulate some considerations.
    First, the percentage of discarded items confirms the effectiveness of decomposing complex generation tasks into simpler subtasks that integrate validation HITs and quality checks based on non-experts&#8217; agreement.
    In fact, on average, around 9.5% of the generated items were discarded without experts&#8217; intervention13.
    Second, the amount of discarded items gives evidence about the relative difficulty of each HIT.
