using lexicalized CFG trees.
    The use of a dependency LM in MT is similar to the use of a structured LM in ASR (Xu et al., 2002), which was also designed to exploit long-distance relations.
    The depLM is used in a bottom-up style, while SLM is employed in a left-to-right style.
  
  
    In this paper, we propose a novel string-todependency algorithm for statistical machine translation.
    For comparison purposes, we replicated the Hiero system as described in (Chiang, 2005).
    Our string-to-dependency system generates 80% fewer rules, and achieves 1.48 point improvement in BLEU and 2.53 point improvement in TER on the decoding output on the NIST 04 Chinese-English evaluation set.
    Dependency structures provide a desirable platform to employ linguistic knowledge in MT.
    In the future, we will continue our research in this direction to carry out translation with deeper features, for example, propositional structures (Palmer et al., 2005).
    We believe that the fixed and floating structures pro
