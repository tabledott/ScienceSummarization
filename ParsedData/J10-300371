 shortcomings of the word alignment techniques.
    To determine how noisy automatic word alignments affect paraphrasing done via bilingual corpora, we inspected a sample of paraphrase pairs that were extracted when using Arabic&#8212;a language significantly different from English&#8212;as the pivot language.11 In this study, we found that the paraphrase pairs in the sample set could be grouped into the following three broad categories: form of one of the words in the phrases and cannot really be considered paraphrases.
    Examples: (ten ton, ten tons), (caused clouds, causing clouds).
    Besides there being obvious linguistic differences between Arabic and English, the primary reason for the generation of phrase pairs that lie in categories (a) and (b) is incorrectly induced alignments between the English and Arabic words, and hence, phrases.
    Therefore, a good portion of subsequent work on paraphrasing using bilingual corpora, as discussed below focuses on using additional machinery or evidence to cop
