more, the objective can be expressed in terms of expectations with respect to these distributions: We now consider how to efficiently solve the max-margin optimization problem for a factored model.
    As shown in Taskar et al. (2003), the dual in Eq.
    3 can be reframed using &#8220;marginal&#8221; terms.
    We will also find it useful to consider this alternative formulation of the dual.
    Given dual variables &#945;, we define the marginals &#181;i,r(&#945;) for all i, r, as follows: Since the dual variables &#945;i form probability distributions over parse trees for each sentence i, the marginals &#181;i,r(&#945;i) represent the proportion of parses that would contain part r if they were drawn from a distribution &#945;i.
    Note that the number of such marginal terms is the number of parts, which is polynomial in the length of the sentence.
    Now consider the dual objective Q(&#945;) in Eq.
    3.
    It can be shown that the original objective Q(&#945;) can be expressed in terms of these 4The co
