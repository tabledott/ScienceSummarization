y (local counts).
    The sense corresponding to the hood root for which the difference between the global and local counts is the greatest is chosen for that word.
    Her results, however, indicate that her technique is not a reliable method for distinguishing WordNet's fine-grained sense distinctions.
    In a similar study, Richardson and Smeaton (1994) create a knowledge base from WordNet's hierarchy and apply a semantic similarity function (developed by Resnik&#8212;see below) to accomplish disambiguation, also for the purposes of information retrieval.
    They provide no formal evaluation but indicate that their results are &amp;quot;promising.&amp;quot; Sussna (1993) computes a semantic distance metric for each of a set of input text terms (nouns) in order to disambiguate them.
    He assigns weights based on the relation type (synonymy, hyperonymy, etc.) to WordNet links, and defines a metric that takes account of the number of arcs of the same type leaving a node and the depth of a given edge in th
