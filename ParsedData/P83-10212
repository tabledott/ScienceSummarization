ese formalisms is definite-clause grammars (DCG) (Pereira and Warren, 1980).
    There is a close relationship between DCGs and other grammar formalisms based on unification. such as Unification Grammar (UG) (Kay, 1979), LFG, PATR-2 (Shieber.
    1983) and the more recent versions of GPSG (Gazdar and Pullum, 1982).
    The parsing algorithms we are concerned with are online algorithms, in the sense that they apply the constraints specified by the augmentation of a rule as soon as the rule is applied.
    In contrast, an online parsing algorithm will consist of two phases: a context-free parsing algorithm followed by application of the constraints to all the resulting analyses.
    The paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 gives an overview of the concepts of definite clause logic, definite clause grammars, definite clause proof procedures, and chart parsing.
    Section 3 discusses the connection betwee DCGs and LFG.
    Section 4 describes the Earley Deduction definite-clause proof procedure.
