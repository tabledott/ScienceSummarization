   In fact, that We now observe that the second-order expectation semiring EP,R,S,T can be obtained indirectly by nesting one first-order expectation semiring inside another!
    First &#8220;lift&#8221; P to obtain the first-order expectation semiring K def = EP,R.
    Then lift this a second time to obtain the &#8220;nested&#8221; first-order expectation semiring EK,X = E(EP,R),(SxT), where we equip Xdef = 5 x T with the operations (s1, t1) + (s2, t2) def = (s1 + s2, t1 + t2) and (p, r)(s, t) def = (ps, pt + rs).
    The resulting first-order expectation semiring has elements of the form ((p, r), (s, t)).
    Table 4 shows that it is indeed isomorphic to EP,R,S,T, with corresponding elements (p, r, s, t).
    This construction of the second-order semiring as a first-order semiring is a useful bit of abstract algebra, because it means that known properties of first-order semirings will also apply to secondorder ones.
    First of all, we are immediately guaranteed that the second-order semiring satisfies the
