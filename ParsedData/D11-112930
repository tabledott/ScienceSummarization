l with the human judgements, from 0.17 to 0.21.
    The additive model continues to make little distinction between senses of the verb during composition, and the multiplicative model&#8217;s alignment does not change, but becomes statistically indistinguishable from the non-compositional baseline model.
    Once again we note that the high-low means are not very indicative of model performance, as the difference between high mean and the low mean of the categorical model is much smaller than that of the both the baseline model and multiplicative model, despite better alignment with annotator judgements.
  
  
    In this paper, we described an implementation of the categorical model of meaning (Coecke et al., 2010), which combines the formal logical and the empirical distributional frameworks into a unified semantic model.
    The implementation is based on building matrices for words with relational types (adjectives, verbs), and vectors for words with atomic types (nouns), based on data from the BNC.
