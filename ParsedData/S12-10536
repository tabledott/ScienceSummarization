l English corpus, a by-product of our data collection methodology, will be publicly released as a further contribution to the research community.2 Each dataset consists of 1,000 pairs (500 for training and 500 for test), balanced across the four entailment judgments (bidirectional, forward, backward, and no entailment).
    For each language combination, the distribution of the four entailment judgments according to length diff is shown in Figure 2.
    Vertical bars represent, for each length diff value, the proportion of pairs belonging to the four entailment classes.
    As can be seen, the length diff constraint applied to the length difference in the monolingual English pairs (step 3 of the creation process) is substantially reflected in the cross-lingual datasets for all language combinations.
    In fact, as shown in Table 1, the majority of the pairs is always included in the same length diff range (approximately [-5,+5]) and, within this range, the distribution of the four classes is substantially un
