ated by selectional restrictions and syntactic cues to identify preferred interpretations.
    The preference combination mechanism of the system uses dynamic measures of strength based on specificity, rather than relying on some fixed, ordered set of rules.
    There are some encouraging results from applying the system to sense tagging of arbitrary text.
    We expect to evaluate our approach on tasks in information retrieval, and, later, machine translation, to determine the likelihood of achieving substantive improvements through sense-based semantic analysis.
