    The conclusion to draw from this example is that the limiting factor in CogNIAC is knowledge sources, not an artificial restriction on domains or kinds of coreference.
    This point will be resumed in the discussion section when what the consequences of fuller knowledge sources would be on CogNIAC.
    For noun phrase anaphora, gathering semantically possible antecedents amounts to running all the noun phrases in a text through various databases for number and gender, and perhaps then a classifier that determines whether a noun phrase is a company, person or place'.
