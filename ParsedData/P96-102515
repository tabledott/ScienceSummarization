ation because most baseNP boundaries are very well defined, so parses which have high enough P(BIS) to be among the highest scoring parses for a sentence tend to have identical or very similar baseNPs.
    Parses are ranked by the following quantity9: Equations (19) and (11) define i)(BIS) and N(DIS,B).
    The parser finds the tree which maximises (20) subject to the hard constraint that dependencies cannot cross.
    91n fact we also model the set of unary productions, U, in the tree, which are of the form P &gt;.
    This introduces an additional term, P(UP,S), into (20).
    This section describes two modifications which improve the model's performance. in the chart Z &lt;.. X Y ..&gt; two of its children X and Y are separated by a comma, then the last word in Y must be directly followed by a comma, or must be the last word in the sentence.
    In training data 96% of commas follow this rule.
    The rule also has the benefit of improving efficiency by reducing the number of constituents in the chart. whe
