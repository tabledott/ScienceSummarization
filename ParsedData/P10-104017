nts, we remove gazetteers and non-local features (Krishnan &amp; Manning, 2006).
    However, we also run experiments that include these features, to understand if the information they provide mostly overlaps with that of the word representations.
    After each epoch over the training set, we measured the accuracy of the model on the development set.
    Training was stopped after the accuracy on the development set did not improve for 10 epochs, generally about 50&#8211;80 epochs total.
    The epoch that performed best on the development set was chosen as the final model.
    We use the following baseline set of features When using the lexical features, we normalize dates and numbers.
    For example, 1980 becomes *DDDD* and 212-325-4751 becomes *DDD**DDD*-*DDDD*.
    This allows a degree of abstraction to years, phone numbers, etc.
    This delexicalization is performed separately from using the word representation.
    That is, if we have induced an embedding for 12/3/2008 , we will use the embedding of
