rs of substantially smaller size and higher accuracy than previous grammar refinement work, starting from a simpler initial grammar.
    For example, even beginning with an X-bar grammar (see Section 1.1) with 98 symbols, our best grammar, using 1043 symbols, achieves a test set F, of 90.2%.
    This is a 27% reduction in error and a significant reduction in size1 over the most accurate grammar in Matsuzaki et al. (2005).
    Our grammar&#8217;s accuracy was higher than fully lexicalized systems, including the maximum-entropy inspired parser of Charniak and Johnson (2005).
    We ran our experiments on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank using the standard setup: we trained on sections 2 to 21, and we used section 1 as a validation set for tuning model hyperparameters.
    Section 22 was used as development set for intermediate results.
    All of section 23 was reserved for the final test.
    We used the EVALB parseval reference implementation, available from Sekine and Collins (1997)
