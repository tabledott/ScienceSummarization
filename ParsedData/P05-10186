our inference procedure is based on a discourse representation that preserves essential entity transition information, and can be computed automatically from raw text.
    Second, we learn patterns of entity distribution from a corpus, without attempting to directly implement or refine Centering constraints.
  
  
    In this section we introduce our entity-based representation of discourse.
    We describe how it can be computed and how entity transition patterns can be extracted.
    The latter constitute a rich feature space on which probabilistic inference is performed.
    Text Representation Each text is represented by an entity grid, a two-dimensional array that captures the distribution of discourse entities across text sentences.
    We follow Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000) in assuming that our unit of analysis is the traditional sentence (i.e., a main clause with accompanying subordinate and adjunct clauses).
    The rows of the grid correspond to sentences, while the columns correspond to discourse e
