  Extraposition Grammars
  
    Extraposition grammars are an extension of definite clause grammars, and are similarly defined in terms of logic clauses.
    The extended formalism makes it easy to describe left extraposition of constituents, an important feature of natural language syntax.

    This paper presents a grammar formalism for natural language analysis, called extraposition grammars (XGs), based on the subset of predicate calculus known as definite, or Horn, clauses.
    It is argued that certain important linguistic phenomena, collectively known in transformational grammar as left extraposition, can be described better in XGs than in earlier grammar formalisms based on definite clauses.
