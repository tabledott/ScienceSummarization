    Within such a theory, where many separate semantic levels (e.g. lexical semantics, compositional semantics, discourse structure, temporal structure) have independent interpretations, the global interpretation of a &amp;quot;discourse&amp;quot; is a highly flexible and malleable structure that has no single interpretation.
    The individual sources of semantic knowledge compute local inferences with a high degree of certainty (cf.
    Hobbs et al. 1988; Charniak and Goldman 1988).
    When integrated together, these inferences must be globally coherent, a state that is accomplished by processes of cooperation among separate semantic modules.
    The basic result of such a view is that semantic interpretation proceeds in a principled fashion, always aware of what the source of a particular inference is, and what the certainty of its value is.
    Such an approach allows the reasoning process to be both tractable and computationally efficient.
    The representation of lexical semantics, therefore, should b
