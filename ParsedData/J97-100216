hese cases were sufficiently rare in the corpora used to develop the coding scheme that it was impractical to include a category for them.
    However, it is possible that in other languages or communicative settings, this behavior will be more prevalent.
    Grice and Savino (1995) found that such a category was necessary when coding Italian Map Task dialogues where speakers were very familiar with each other.
    They called the category OBJECT.
    In addition to the initiation and response moves, the coding scheme identifies READY moves as moves that occur after the close of a dialogue game and prepare the conversation for a new game to be initiated.
    Speakers often use utterances such as &amp;quot;OK&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; to serve this purpose.
    It is a moot point whether READY moves should form a distinct move class or should be treated as discourse markers attached to the subsequent moves, but the distinction is not a critical one, since either interpretation can be placed on th
