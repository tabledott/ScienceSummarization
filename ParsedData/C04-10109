			3 Memory-Based Learning.
			Memory-based learning and problem solving is based on two fundamental principles: learning is thesimple storage of experiences in memory, and solv ing a new problem is achieved by reusing solutionsfrom similar previously solved problems (Daele mans, 1999).
			It is inspired by the nearest neighborapproach in statistical pattern recognition and arti ficial intelligence (Fix and Hodges, 1952), as well as the analogical modeling approach in linguistics(Skousen, 1989; Skousen, 1992).
			In machine learning terms, it can be characterized as a lazy learning method, since it defers processing of input un til needed and processes input by combining stored data (Aha, 1997).
			Memory-based learning has been successfully applied to a number of problems in natural languageprocessing, such as grapheme-to-phoneme conver sion, part-of-speech tagging, prepositional-phr
