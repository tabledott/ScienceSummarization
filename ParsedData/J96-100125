h English collocations (Smadja 1993), is supported for less opaque collocations by the fact that their constituent words tend to have a single sense when they appear in the collocation (Yarowsky 1993), and was verified during our evaluation of Champollion (Section 7).
    We construct a mathematical model of the events we want to correlate, namely, the appearance of any word or group of words in the sentences of our corpus, as follows: To each group of words G, in either the source or the target language, we map a binary random variable XG that takes the value &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; if G appears in a particular sentence and &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; if not.
    Then, the corpus of paired sentences comprising our database represents a collection of samples for the various random variables X for the various groups of words.
    Each new sentence in the corpus provides a new independent sample for every variable XG.
    For example, if G is unemployment rate and the words unemployment rate appear only in the fifth an
