v(Y) and conv(Z) respectively.
    Hence any point in Q is also in Q0.
    It follows that any point in conv(Q) is also in Q0, because Q0 is a convex set defined by linear constraints.
    The LP relaxation then corresponds to the following optimization problem: Q0 is defined by linear constraints, making this a linear program.
    Since Q0 is an outer bound on conv(Q), i.e. conv(Q) &#8838; Q0, we obtain the guarantee that the value of Eq.
    10 always upper bounds the value of Eq.
    9.
    In Appendix A we give an example showing that in general Q0 includes points that are not in conv(Q).
    These points exist because the agreement between the two parts is now enforced in expectation (&#181;(i, t) = v(i, t) for (i, t) &#8712; Iuni) rather than based on actual assignments.
    This agreement constraint is weaker since different distributions over assignments can still result in the same first order expectations.
    Thus, the solution to Eq.
    10 may be in Q0 but not in conv(Q).
    It can be shown that
