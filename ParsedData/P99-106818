 judged cases, STRAND is in agreement with the combined human judgment more often than the human judges agree with each other.
    The recall figure indicates that for every true translation pair it accepts, STRAND must also incorrectly reject a true translation pair.
    Alternatively, this can be interpreted as saying that the filtering process has the system identifying about half of the pairs it could in principle have found given the candidates produced by the generation stage.
    Error analysis suggests that recall could be increased (at a possible cost to precision) by making structural filtering more intelligent; for example, ignoring some types of markup (such as italics) when computing alignments.
    However, I presume that if the number M of translation pairs on the Web is large, then half of M is also large.
    Therefore I focus on increasing the total yield by attempting to bring the number of generated candidate pairs closer to M, as described in the next section.
