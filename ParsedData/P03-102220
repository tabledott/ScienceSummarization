y ever done systematically.
    E.g.
    Soon et al. (2001) only compared baseline systems consisting of one feature each, only three of which yielded an f-measure greater than zero.
    Then they combined these features and achieved results which were close to the best overall results they report.
    While this tells us which features contribute a lot, it does not give any information about potential (positive or negative) influence of the rest.
    Ng &amp; Cardie (2002) select the set of features by hand, giving a preference to high precision features.
    They admit that this method is quite subjective.
    Corpus-based work about pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue is almost non-existent.
    However, there are a few papers dealing with neuter pronouns with NP-antecedents.
    E.g., Dagan &amp; Itai (1991) presented a corpus-based approach to the resolution of the pronoun it, but they use a written text corpus and do not mention non-NP-antecedents at all.
    Paul et al. (1999) presented a corpus-base
