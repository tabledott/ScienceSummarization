term in a bounded number of entries.
    The obvious first choice is the most strongly weighted attributes from the full vector.
    Figure 3 shows some of the most strongly weighted attributes for pants with their frequencies and weights.
    However, these attributes, although strongly correlated with pants, are in fact too specific and idiomatic to be a good summary, because there are very few other words with similar canonical attributes.
    For example, (adjective, smarty) only appears with two other terms (bun and number) in the entire corpus.
    The heuristic is so aggressive that too few positive approximate matches result.
    To alleviate this problem we filter the attributes so that only strongly weighted subject, direct-obj and indirect-obj relations are included in the canonical vectors.
    This is because in general they constrain the terms more and partake in fewer idiomatic collocations with the terms.
    So the general principle is the most descriptive verb relations constrain the search
