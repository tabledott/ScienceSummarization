an utilize what other processes have done already.
    The number of stacks in the stack list grows exponentially as ambiguities are encountered.3 For example, these 14 processes in Figure 2.3 will parse the rest of the sentence the telescope 14 I saw a man on the bed in the apartment with a telescope (with the the grammar and the table in Figures 2.1 and 2.2). times in exactly the same way.
    This can be avoided by using a tree-structured stack, which is described in the following subsection.
    If two processes are in a common state, that is, if two stacks have a common state number at the rightmost vertex, they will behave in exactly the same manner until the vertex is popped from the stacks by a reduce action.
    To avoid this redundant operation, these processes are unified into one process by combining their stacks.
    Whenever two or more processes have a common state number on the top of their stacks, the top vertices are unified, and these stacks are represented as a tree, where the top vertex c
