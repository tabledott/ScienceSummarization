easing order.
    We start from the top of this list and work our way downwards until we find a word that fails either of the following tests: Once a word fails one of the above tests, we are guaranteed that all subsequent words in the list (with lower local frequencies) will also fail the same test.
    By applying these two tests and removing all closed-class words from the list, we greatly reduce the number of words that must be considered.
    In practice, about 90-98% of the words in the list fail to meet the two tests above, so we dramatically reduce our search space without having to perform any relatively expensive operations.
    For the remaining words in the list, we need to compute their Dice coefficient value so as to select the best-ranking one-word translation of the source collocation.
    The first of the above tests is rather obviously valid and easy to apply.
    For the second test, we compute an upper bound for the Dice coefficient between the word under consideration and the source collo
