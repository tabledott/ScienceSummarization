    Most previous work on summarization has focused on extractive summarization: selecting text spans - either complete sentences or paragraphs &#8211; from the original document.
    These extracts are then arranged in a linear order (usually the same order as in the original document) to form a summary document.
    There are several possible drawbacks to this approach, one of which is the focus of this paper: the inability to generate coherent summaries shorter than the smallest textspans being considered &#8211; usually a sentence, and sometimes a paragraph.
    This can be a problem, because in many situations, a short headline style indicative summary is desired.
    Since, in many cases, the most important information in the document is scattered across multiple sentences, this is a problem for extractive summarization; worse, sentences ranked best for summary selection often tend to be even longer than the average sentence in the document.
