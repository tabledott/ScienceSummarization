man's preferred relations.
    The Kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan 1988) for the task of judging system tags as correct and incorrect is &#954; = 0.78 whereas the task of identifying the preferred semantic relation has &#954; = 0.72.
    For the latter task, the two judges agreed on 73 of the 100 semantic relations.
    73% gives an idea of an upper bound for humans on this task.
    On these 73 relations, the system achieved a higher accuracy of 70.0%.
    The system is allowed to output the happens-before relation in combination with other relations.
    On the 17 happens-before relations output by the system, 67.6% were judged correct.
    Ignoring the happens-before relations, we achieved a Tags Correct precision of 68%.
    Table 5 shows the accuracy of the system on each of the relations.
    The stronger-than relation is a subset of the similarity relation.
    Considering a coarser extraction where stronger-than relations are merged with similarity, the task of judging system tags and the task o
