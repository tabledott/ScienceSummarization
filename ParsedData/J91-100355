bout the typical contents of a certain container, for example, some glasses as in (7) &#8212; whereas the contents do not generally have the function of being the contents of something.
    Hence it makes sense to drive inferencing from the container, and the function it performs, toward the contents than vice versa.
    The same reasoning applies to ARTIST FOR ART FORM (target-driven).
    An artist has the vocation of creating art: that is his/her purpose.
    A further step in collation distinguishes metaphorical from anomalous semantic relations.
    Recall that a metaphorical relation contains a relevant analogy, as in (15) and (20), while an anomalous relation does not, as in (21).
    A relevant analogy is found by matching the relevant cell from the source sense-frame with one of the cells from the target sense-frame.
    If the match of cells is composed of a set of sister network paths between corresponding word senses in those cells, then this is interpreted as analogical and hence indicative of a
