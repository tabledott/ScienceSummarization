ures for all nouns in a domain.
    Since it is our belief that such representations are generic structures across all domains, it is our long-term goal to develop methods for automatically extracting these relations and values from on-line corpora.
    In the sections that follow, we describe several experiments indicating that the qualia structures do, in fact, correlate with well-behaved collocational patterns, thereby allowing us to perform structure-matching operations over corpora to find these relations.
    In this section we discuss briefly how a lexical semantic theory can help in extracting information from machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs).
    We describe research on conversion of a machine-tractable dictionary (Wilks et al. 1993) into a usable lexical knowledge base (Boguraev 1991).
    Although the results here are preliminary, it is important to mention the process of converting an MRD into a lexical knowledge base, so that the process of corpus-tuning is put into the proper perspective.
