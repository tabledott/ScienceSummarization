ce summaries displayed in the same figure).
    Another important aspect of TextRank is that it gives a ranking over all sentences in a text &#8211; which means that it can be easily adapted to extracting very short summaries (headlines consisting of one The evaluation is done using the Ngram(1,1) setting of ROUGE, which was found to have the highest correlation with human judgments, at a confidence level of 95%.
    Only the first 100 words in each summary are considered. sentence), or longer more explicative summaries, consisting of more than 100 words.
    We are also investigating combinations of keyphrase and sentence extraction techniques as a method for building short/long summaries.
    Finally, another advantage of TextRank over previously proposed methods for building extractive summaries is the fact that it does not require training corpora, which makes it easily adaptable to other languages or domains.
  
  
    Intuitively, TextRank works well because it does not only rely on the local context of
