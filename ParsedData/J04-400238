antiation Z = (z, j).
    Hence, the set of all alignment template instantiations for the source sentence fJ1 is If the source sentence contains words that have not been seen in the training data, we introduce a new alignment template that performs a one-to-one translation of each of these words by itself.
    In the second step, we determine a set of probable target language words for each target word position in the alignment template instantiation.
    Only these words are then hypothesized in the search.
    We call this selection of highly probable words observation pruning (Tillmann and Ney 2000).
    As a criterion for a word e at position i in the alignment template instantiation, we use In our experiments, we hypothesize only the five best-scoring words.
    A decision is a triple d = (Z, e,l) consisting of an alignment template instantiation Z, the generated word e, and the index l of the generated word in Z.
    A hypothesis n corresponds to a valid sequence of decisions di1.
    The possible decis
