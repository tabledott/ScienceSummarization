ion 2.4, each link contains the title name of an en tity, and the proper name (the display string) used to refer to it.
			We use the term query to denote the occurrence of a proper name inside a Wikipedia article.
			If there is a dictionary entry matching the proper name in the query q such that the set of denoted entities q:E contains at least two entities, one of them the true answer entity q:e, then the query q is included in the dataset.
			More exactly, if q:E contains n named entities e 1 , e 2 , ..., e n , then the dataset will be augmented with n pairs hq; e k i represented as follows: hq; e k i = [?(e k ; q:e) j q:T j e k :title] The field q:T contains all words occurring in a limit length window centered on the proper name.
			The window size is set to 55, which is the value that was observed to give optimum performance in the related task of cross-document coreference (Gooi and Allan, 2004).
			The Kronecker delta function ?(e k ; q:e) is 1 when e k is the same as the entity q:e referred in the l
