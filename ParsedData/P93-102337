l feature of our approach.
    The system's results can be filtered to produce scalar adjectives that are applicable in any given domain.
    Furthermore, while we have demonstrated the algorithm on adjectives, it can be directly applied to other word classes once sources of linguistic information for judging their similarity have been identified.
    Our immediate plans are to incorporate more similarity modules into stage two of the system and add a training component to stage three so that the relative weights of the various modules can be estimated.
    We have identified several additional sources of linguistic knowledge which look promising, namely pairs of adjectives separated by connectives and adverb-adjective pairs.
    We also plan to extend the adjective-noun module to cover adjectives in predicative positions, in addition to our current use of attributive adjectives.
    These extensions not only will provide us with a better way of exploiting the information in the corpus but may also help us ca
