s an attachment to a head verb or noun, and f is a feature, or a combination of features, of the attachment.
    Cornmon features are the words involved in the attachment, such as the head verb or noun, the preposition, and the head word of the PP.
    Applying committee-based selection to supervised training for such tasks can be done analogously to its application in the current papers.
    Furthermore, committee-based selection may be attempted also for training non-probabilistic classifiers, where explicit modeling of information gain is typically impossible.
    In such contexts, committee members might be generated by randomly varying some of the decisions made in the learning algorithm.
    Another important area for future work is in developing sample selection methods which are independent of the eventual learning method to be applied.
    This would be of considerable advantage in developing selectively annotated corpora for general research use.
