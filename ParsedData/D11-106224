ent relations: i) 449 bidirectional entailments, ii) 491 ENG&#8594;ENG1 unidirectional entailments, and iii) 680 ENG&#8592;ENG1 unidirectional entailments.
    It must be noted that our methodology does not lead to the creation of pairs where some information is provided in one text and not in the other, and viceversa, as Example 1 shows: ENG: New theories were emerging in the field of psychology.
    ENG1: New theories were rising, which announced a kind of veiled racism.
    These negative examples in both directions represent a natural extension of the dataset, relevant also for specific application-oriented scenarios, and their creation will be addressed in future work.
    Besides the achievement of our primary objectives, the adopted approach led to some interesting by-products.
    First, the generated corpora are perfectly suitable to produce entailment datasets similar to those used in the traditional RTE evaluation framework.
    In particular, considering any possible entailment relation between tw
