and Mercer (1984) have introduced a technique for automatically discovering relevant features for the translation of word spelling to word pronunciation.
    These efforts, while varied in specifics, all confront two essential tasks of statistical modeling.
    The first task is to determine a set of statistics that captures the behavior of a random process.
    Given a set of statistics, the second task is to corral these facts into an accurate model of the process&#8212;a model capable of predicting the future output of the process.
    The first task is one of feature selection; the second is one of model selection.
    In the following pages we present a unified approach to these two tasks based on the maximum entropy philosophy.
    In Section 2 we give an overview of the maximum entropy philosophy and work through a motivating example.
    In Section 3 we describe the mathematical structure of maximum entropy models and give an efficient algorithm for estimating the parameters of such models.
