 generalize the above notions to define DCGs.
    DCG nonterminals have arguments in the same way that predicates do.
    A DCG nonterminal with n arguments is translated into a predicate of n+2 arguments, the last two of which are the string points, as in the translation of context-free rules into definite clauses.
    The context-free grammar obtained from a DCG by dropping all nonterminal arguments is the contextfree skeleton of the DCG.
    The fundamental inference rule for definite clauses is the following resolution rule: From the clauses The proof procedure of Prolog is just a particular embedding of the resolution rule in a search procedure, in which a goal clause like (2) is successively rewritten by the resolution rule usii:g clauses from the program (I).
    The Prolog proof procedure can be implemented very efficiently. but it has the same theoretical problems of the top-down backtrack parsing algorithms after which it is modeled.
    These problems do not preclude its use for creating uniquely e
