 the referent of the pronoun p and a is a proposed antecedent.
    In the conditioning events, h is the head constituent above p,i/ir is the list of candidate antecedents to be considered, t is the type of phrase of the proposed antecedent (always a noun-phrase in this study), 1 is the type of the head constituent, sp describes the syntactic structure in which p appears, cr specifies the distance of each antecedent from p and M is the number of times the referent is mentioned.
    Note that W, d, and M are vector quantities in which each entry corresponds to a possible antecedent.
    When viewed in this way, a can be regarded as an index into these vectors that specifies which value is relevant to the particular choice of antecedent.
    This equation is decomposed into pieces that correspond to all the above factors but are more statistically manageable.
    The decomposition makes use of Bayes' theorem and is based on certain independence assumptions discussed below.
    Equation (1) is simply an applicati
