  Char Align: A Program For Aligning Parallel Texts At The Character Level
  
    have been a number of recent papers on aligning parallel texts at the sentence level, e.g., Brown al and Church (to appear), Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rosenschein (to appear), Simard al Warwick&#8212; Armstrong and Russell (1990).
    On clean inputs, such as the Canadian Hansards, these methods have been very successful (at least 96% correct by sentence).
    Unfortunately, if the input is noisy (due to OCR and/or unknown markup conventions), then these methods tend to break down because the noise can make it difficult to find boundaries, let alone sentences.
    This paper describes a new program, aligns texts at the level rather than at the sentence/paragraph level, based on the cognate approach proposed by Simard al.
  
  
    Parallel texts have recently received considerable attention in machine translation (e.g., Brown et al, 1990), bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990), and terminology research for
