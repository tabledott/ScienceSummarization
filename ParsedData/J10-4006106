ic), and q obj n (Agentive).
    Consequently, DepDM does not harvest Formal qualia, and is penalized accordingly in the evaluation.
    We project all W1W2xL vectors that contain a target noun onto each of the four subspaces determined by the quale-specific link sets, and we compute their subspace lengths.
    Given a target noun n and a potential quale q, the length of the (n, q) vector in the subspace characterized by the links that represent role r is our measure of how good q is as a quale of type r for n (for example, the length of (book, read) in the subspace defined by the Telic links is our measure of fitness of read as Telic role of book).
    We use length in the subspace associated to the qualia role r to rank all (n, q) pairs relevant to r. Following Cimiano and Wenderoth&#8217;s evaluation method, for each noun we first compute, separately for each role, the ranked list precision (with respect to the manually constructed qualia structure) at 11 equally spaced recall levels from 0% to 100%.
