ndow size has an interesting effect on the types of clusters.
    With larger windows, the clusters tend to be more topical, whereas smaller windows result in categorical clusters.
    For example, Table 1 contains the cluster that the phrase &#8220;English lessons&#8221; belongs to.
    With 3word context windows, the cluster is about language learning and translation.
    With 1-word context windows, the cluster contains different types of lessons.
    The ability to produce both kinds of clusters turns out to be very useful.
    In different applications we need different types of clusters.
    For example, in the named entity recognition task, categorical clusters are more successful, whereas in query categorization, the topical clusters are much more beneficial.
    The Brown algorithm uses essentially the same information as our 1-word window clusters.
    We therefore expect it to produce mostly categorical clusters.
    Although K-Means is generally described as a hard clustering algorithm (each eleme
