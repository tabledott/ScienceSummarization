tions.
    First, each pattern extracts only one item, which causes the output to be artificially fragmented.
    For example, the sentence &amp;quot;Guerrillas kidnapped the mayor in Bogota&amp;quot; produces three extractions (Guerrillas, the mayor, and Bogota), each in a separate structure.
    This fragmented representation causes unnecessary work for subsequent components that need to piece the information back together.
    Second, the patterns do not include semantic constraints so they produce many spurious extractions.'
    Theoretically, conceptual case frames should overcome both of these limitations.
    Multi-slot case frames will allow several role objects associated with the same event to be instantiated as part of the same structure.
    This produces a more coherent representation, which is more natural for subsequent event or discourse processing.
    Furthermore, if each slot has selectional restrictions associated with its legal role objects, then the case frames should produce fewer false
