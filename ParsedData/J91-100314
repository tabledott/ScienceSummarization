    Selective inferencing is concerned with drawing or refraining from drawing certain inferences in a controlled fashion (cf.
    Hobbs 1983a).
    He argues that many problems have the same or almost the same inferencing solutions.
    These solutions are found via four separate semantic operations that all draw inferences from text (e.g., Hobbs 1977).
    2.1.3 The Selection Restrictions Violations View.
    The selection restriction violation view has also been called &amp;quot;the semantic deviance view&amp;quot; (Johnson 1980, p. 50) and &amp;quot;the anomaly view&amp;quot; (Tourangeau and Sternberg 1982, p. 211).
    Johnson (1980) describes this view as a common one among linguists; Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982) list the following people as holders of this view: Beardsley (1962), Bickerton (1969), Campbell (1975), Guenther (1975), Percy (1954), Van Dijk (1975), and Wheelwright (1962).
    To this list one might add Levin (1977).
    Johnson (1980, p. 50) describes this view as where:
