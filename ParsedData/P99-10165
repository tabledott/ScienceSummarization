each of the internal nodes with a hypernym describing its descendant nouns.
  
  
    Following WordNet, a word A is said to be a hypernym of a word B if native speakers of English accept the sentence &amp;quot;B is a (kind of) A.&amp;quot; To determine possible hypernyms for a particular noun, we use the same parsed text described in the previous section.
    As suggested in Hearst (1992), we can find some hypernym data in the text by looking for conjunctions involving the word &amp;quot;other&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;X, Y, and other Zs&amp;quot; (patterns 3 and 4 in Hearst).
    From this phrase we can extract that Z is likely a hypernym for both X and Y.
    This data is extracted from the parsed text, and for each noun we construct a vector of hypernyms, with a value of 1 if a word has been seen as a hypernym for this noun and 0 otherwise.
    These vectors are associated with the leaves of the binary tree constructed in the previous section.
    For each internal node of the tree, we construct a vector
