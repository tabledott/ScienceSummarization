ts for the two readability categories.
    Table 10 summarizes our results on the readability assessment task.
    We first compared Schwarm and Ostendorf&#8217;s (2005) system against a system that incorporates entity-based coherence features (see rows 3&#8211;4 in Table 10).
    As can be seen, the system&#8217;s accuracy significantly increases by 10% when the full feature set is included (Coreference+Syntax+Salience+).
    Entity-grid features that do not incorporate coreference information (Coreference&#8722;Syntax+Salience+) perform numerically better (compare row 1 and 3 in Table 10); however, the difference is not statistically significant.
    The superior performance of the Coreference+Syntax+Salience+ feature set is not entirely unexpected.
    Inspection of our corpus revealed that easy and difficult texts differ in their distribution of pronouns and coreference chains in general.
    Easy texts tend to employ less coreference and the use of personal pronouns is relatively sparse.
