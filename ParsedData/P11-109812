ures our similarity of two events: We run agglomerative clustering with pmi over all event patterns.
    Merging decisions use the average link score between all new links across two clusters.
    As with all clustering algorithms, a stopping criterion is needed.
    We continue merging clusters until any single cluster grows beyond m patterns.
    We briefly inspected the clustering process and chose m = 40 to prevent learned scenarios from intuitively growing too large and ambiguous.
    Post-evaluation analysis shows that this value has wide flexibility.
    For example, the Kidnap and Arson clusters are unchanged in 30 &lt; m &lt; 80, and Bombing unchanged in 30 &lt; m &lt; 50.
    Figure 1 shows 3 clusters (of 77 learned) that characterize the main template types.
    Learning a domain often suffers from a lack of training data.
    The previous section clustered events from the MUC-4 corpus, but its 1300 documents do not provide enough examples of verbs and argument counts to further learn the semantic
