propositions for which all the arguments were identified correctly from 0% to about 46% can be seen.
    Relatively few predicates, 107 out of 4500, were affected by this combination.
    To give an idea of what the potential improvements of the combinations could be, we performed an oracle experiment for a combined system that tags head words instead of exact constituents as we did in case of Minipar-based and Charniak-based semantic parser earlier.
    In case of chunks, first word in prepositional base phrases was selected as the head word, and for all other chunks, the last word was selected to be the head word.
    If the correct argument was found present in either the Charniak, Minipar or Chunk hypotheses then that was selected.
    The results for this are shown in Table 14.
    It can be seen that the head word based performance almost approaches the constituent based performance reported on the hand-corrected parses in Table 3 and there seems to be considerable scope for improvement. based scoring a
