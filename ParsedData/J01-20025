    In general, it has been shown that, when the errors are uncorrelated to a sufficient degree, the resulting combined classifier will often perform better than any of the individual systems.
    In this paper we wish to take a more empirical approach and examine whether these methods result in substantial accuracy improvements in a situation typical for statistical NLP, namely, learning morphosyntactic word class tagging (also known as part-of-speech or POS tagging) from an annotated corpus of several hundred thousand words.
    Morphosyntactic word class tagging entails the classification (tagging) of each token of a natural language text in terms of an element of a finite palette (tagset) of word class descriptors (tags).
    The reasons for this choice of task are several.
    First of all, tagging is a widely researched and well-understood task (see van Halteren [1999]).
    Second, current performance levels on this task still leave room for improvement: &amp;quot;state-of-the-art&amp;quot; perf
