scourse sequence with explicit linguistic signals for a parallel structure.
    Examples follow: Parallelisms in (20) and (21) are clearly signalled with (i) the same verbal expressions (talk to and be found near) and (ii) the word too.
    In such cases, a version of the property-sharing scheme would propose the correct specification of the single pronoun as the first choice.
    Since the pronouns are nonSUBJECT', they should co-specify with the nonSUBJECT in the first utterance, which are Tom and the wild rose, respectively.I6 Significant here is the fact that (21) was a problem case for Sidner's (1979) focusing-based pronoun interpretation algorithm.
    She in fact concluded that pronoun interpretation involving structural parallelism was a source for anaphora inherently different from focusing: &amp;quot;Focussing cannot account for the detection of parallel structure, not only because the computation of such structure is poorly understood, but also because focussing chooses different defaults for co-sp
