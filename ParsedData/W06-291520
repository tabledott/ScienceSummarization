l directly on the sentences and attempt to classify a sentence as reflecting either a Palestinian or Israeli perspective.
    A sentence is correctly classified if the predicted perspective for the sentence is the same as the perspective of the document from which it was extracted.
    Using this model, we obtain a classification accuracy of only 0.7529, which is much lower than the accuracy previously achieved at the document level.
    Identifying perspectives at the sentence level is thus more difficult than identifying perspectives at the document level.
    The high accuracy at the document level shows that LSPM is very effective in pooling evidence from sentences that individually contain little perspective information.
  
  
    In this paper we study a new problem of learning to identify the perspective from which a text is written at the document and sentence levels.
    We show that much of a document&#8217;s perspective is expressed in word usage, and statistical learning algorithms such as SVM and
