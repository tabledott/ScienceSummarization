ith the Am/ node: In the original formulation of LFG, the f-structure of the highest node was singled out and assigned a special status.
    In our current theory we do not distinguish that structure from all the others in the range of cp: the grammatical analysis of a sentence includes the complete enumeration of 4)-associations.
    The S-node's f-structure typically does contain the f-structures of all other nodes as subsidiary elements, but not in this adverbial case.
    The target structures corresponding to the various f-structures are also not required to be integrated.
    These target f-structures can then be set in correspondence with any nodes of the target c-structure, subject to the constraints imposed by the target grammar.
    In this case, the fact that venir takes an XCOMP which corresponds to the ARG of just means that the target f-structure mapped from the ADV's f-structure will be associated with the highest node of the target c-structure.
    This is shown in (25).
    The above analysis
