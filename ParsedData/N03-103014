d tree among all . the words in .The node in which occurs highest is called the head node of edu and is denoted .
    The edu which has as head node the root of the DS-LST is called the exception edu.
    In our example, the head word for edu 2 is , and its head node is ; the head word for edu 3 is , and its head node is .
    The exception edu is edu 1.
    For each edu which is not the exception edu, there exists a node which is the parent of the head node of , and the lexical head of this node is guaranteed to belong to a different edu than , call it .
    We call this node the attachment node of and denote it .
    In our example, the attachment node of edu 2 is , and its lexical head says belongs to edu 1; the attachment node of edu 3 is , and its lexical head use belongs to edu 2.
    We write formally that two edus and are linked through a head node and an attachment node as .
    The dominance set of a DS-LST is given by all the edu pairs linked through a head node and an attachment node in the DS-LST
