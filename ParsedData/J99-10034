ognizer (SIMR), a generic pattern recognition algorithm that is particA bitext space. ularly well suited to mapping bitext correspondence.
    SIMR demonstrates that, given effective signal generators and noise filters, it is possible to map bitext correspondence with high accuracy in linear space and time.
    If necessary, SIMR can be used with the Geometric Segment Alignment (GSA) algorithm, which uses segment boundary information to reduce general bitext maps to segment alignments.
    Evaluations on preexisting gold standards have shown that SIMR's bitext maps and GSA's alignments are more accurate than those of comparable algorithms in the literature.
    The article begins with a geometric interpretation of the bitext mapping problem and a discussion of previous work.
    SIMR is detailed in Section 4 and evaluated in Section 6.
    Section 7 discusses the formal relationship between bitext maps and segment alignments.
    The GSA algorithm for converting from the former to the latter is presented in S
