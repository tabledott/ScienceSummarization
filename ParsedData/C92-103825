  Find- best-value returns Objectl~s basic-level colour value, which is black, since no more specific colour term has more discriminatory power.
  Make-referring- expression then adds (colour, black) to L and removes rules-out((colour, black)) = {Object2} from D. D is then empty, so the generation task is completed, ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~r 1992 2 3 6 PROC.
