 semantic level of representation is a more domain-independent, robust level of representation.
    Identifying these roles, for example, could allow a system to determine that in the sentence &amp;quot;The first one crashed&amp;quot; the subject is the vehicle, but in the sentence &amp;quot;The first one crashed it&amp;quot; the subject is the agent, which would help in information extraction in this domain.
    Another application is in wordsense disambiguation, where the roles associated with a word can be cues to its sense.
    For example, Lapata and Brew (1999) and others have shown that the different syntactic subcatgorization frames of a verb like &amp;quot;serve&amp;quot; can be used to help disambiguate a particular instance of the word &amp;quot;serve&amp;quot;.
    Adding semantic role subcategorization information to this syntactic information could extend this idea to use richer semantic knowledge.
    Semantic roles could also act as an important intermediate representation in statistical machi
