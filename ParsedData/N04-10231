Och and Ney, 2002) and gradient methods (Och, 2003), have been applied to machine translation (MT), and have provided significant improvements.
    In this paper, we introduce two novel machine learning algorithms specialized for the MT task.
    Discriminative reranking algorithms have also contributed to improvements in natural language parsing and tagging performance.
    Discriminative reranking algorithms used for these applications include Perceptron, Boosting and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
    In the machine learning community, some novel discriminative ranking (also called ordinal regression) algorithms have been proposed in recent years.
    Based on this work, in this paper, we will present some novel discriminative reranking techniques applied to machine translation.
    The reranking problem for natural language is neither a classification problem nor a regression problem, and under certain conditions MT reranking turns out to be quite different from parse reranking.
    In this paper, we con
