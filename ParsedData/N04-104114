aluation of the remaining 1411 concepts.
    We randomly selected 125 concepts and their top-5 highest ranking names according to our algorithm.
    Table 1 shows the first 10 randomly selected concepts (each concept is represented by three of its committee members).
    For each concept, we added to the list of names a human generated name (obtained from an annotator looking at only the concept instances).
    We also appended concept names extracted from WordNet.
    For each concept that contains at least five instances in the WordNet hierarchy, we named the concept with the most frequent common ancestor of each pair of instances.
    Up to five names were generated by WordNet for each concept.
    Because of the low coverage of proper nouns in WordNet, only 33 of the 125 concepts we evaluated had WordNet generated labels.
    We presented to three human judges the 125 randomly selected concepts together with the system, human, and WordNet generated names randomly ordered.
    That way, there was no way fo
