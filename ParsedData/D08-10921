hiang, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008), but also linguistic tree structures of either the source side (Huang et al., 2006; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Quirk et al., 2005), the target side (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2004; Zollmann et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008), or both (Och et al., 2003; Aue et al., 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005).
    These methods all rely on automatic parsing of one or both sides of input bitexts and are therefore impacted by parser quality.
    Unfortunately, parsing general bitexts well can be a challenge for newswiretrained treebank parsers for many reasons, including out-of-domain input and tokenization issues.
    On the other hand, the presence of translation pairs offers a new source of information: bilingual constraints.
    For example, Figure 1 shows a case where a state-of-the-art English parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) has chosen an incorrect structure which is incompatible with the (correctly chosen) output of a comparable Chinese parser.
