 et al. (2003) present an algorithm that queries the Web using lexical patterns for distinguishing noun synonymy and antonymy.
    Our approach addresses verbs and provides for a richer and finer-grained set of semantics.
    Reliability of estimating bigram counts on the web via search engines has been investigated by Keller and Lapata (2003).
    Semantic networks have also been extracted from dictionaries and other machine-readable resources.
    MindNet (Richardson et al. 1998) extracts a collection of triples of the type &amp;quot;ducks have wings&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;duck capable-of flying&amp;quot;.
    This resource, however, does not relate verbs to each other or provide verb semantics.
  
  
    In this section, we introduce and motivate the specific relations that we extract.
    Whilst the natural language literature is rich in theories of semantics (Barwise and Perry 1985; Schank and Abelson 1977), large-coverage manually created semantic resources typically only organize verbs into a flat or
