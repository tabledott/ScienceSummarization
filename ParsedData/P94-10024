hs might indicate dense discussions of a topic, while long spindly chains of connectivity might indicate a sequential account (see Figure 1).
    The central idea is that of defining the structure of a text as a function of the connectivity patterns of the terms that comprise it.
    This is in contrast with segmenting guided primarily by fine-grained discourse cues such as register change, focus shift, and cue words.
    From a computational viewpoint, deducing textual topic structure from lexical connectivity alone is appealing, both because it is easy to compute, and also because discourse cues are sometimes misleading with respect to the topic structure (Brown &amp; Yule 1983)(&#167;3).
    I Additionally, (Passonneau 8.6 Litman 1993) concede the difficulty of eliciting hierarchical intentional structure with any degree of consistency from their human judges.
    The topology most of interest to this work is the final one in the diagram, the Piecewise Monolithic Structure, since it represents sequences of
