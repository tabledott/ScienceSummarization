    A set 13 of brackets over an utterance U is a bracketing of U if every word in U is in some bracket and for any X, Y E 13 either X n Y = 0, X C_ Y or Y C_ X (noncrossing brackets).
    The depth of a word x E U under a bracket B E 13 (x E B) is the maximal number of brackets X1, ... , X,,, E 13 such that x E X1 C ... C X,,, C B.
    A word x is agenerator of depth d of B in 13 if x is of minimal depth under B (among all words in B) and that depth is d. A bracket may have more than one generator.
    A common cover link over an utterance U is a triple x d* y where x, y E U, x 74 y and d is a nonnegative integer.
    The word x is the base of the link, the word y is its head and d is the depth of the link.
    The common cover link set RB associated with a bracketing 13 is the set of common cover links over U such that x d* y E RB iff the word x is a generator of depth d of the smallest bracket B E 13 such that x, y E B (see figure
