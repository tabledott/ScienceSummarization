in ter,for example, a blizzard of frozen carbon dioxide rages over one pole, and a few meters of this dryice snow accumulate as previously frozen carbon dioxide evaporates from the opposite polar cap.9] [Yet even on the summer pole, (where the sun remains in the sky all day long, } temperatures never warm enough to melt frozen water.m] Since parenthetical information is related only to the elementary unit that it belongs to, we do not assign it an elementary textual unit status.
    Such an assignment will only create problems at the formal level as well, because then discourse structures can no longer be represented as binary trees.
    On the basis of the data derived from the corpus analysis, the algorithm hypothesizes the following set of relations between the textual units: The algorithm then determines all the valid discourse trees that can be built for elementary units 1 to 10, given the constraints in (4).
    In this case, the algorithm constructs 8 different trees.
    The trees are ordered accordin
