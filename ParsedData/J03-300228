ter and automatic language identification to verify that the pages are in the appropriate languages.
    Chen and Nie report a 95% precise English-French corpus of 118MB/135MB of text and a 90% precise English-Chinese corpus of 137MB/117MB of text, based on inspection.
    Later versions of PTMiner include a final filtering stage to clean the extracted corpus; Nie and Cai (2001) independently used features similar to those described here to eliminate noisy pairs.
    Specifically, they used a file length ratio filter, the proportion of sentences that are aligned to empty (after a sentence alignment algorithm is applied), and a criterion that rewards sentence pairs that contain elements from a bilingual dictionary.
    Nie and Cai showed that hand-tuned combination of these criteria improved the quality of their parallel English-Chinese corpus by 8% (F-measure) at the text level.
    Bilingual Internet Text Search (BITS) (Ma and Liberman 1999) starts with a given list of domains to search for parallel text.
