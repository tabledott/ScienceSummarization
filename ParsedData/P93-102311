    From the minimal NP, we produce the different pairs of adjectives and nouns, assuming that all adjectives modify the head noun3.
    This assumption is rarely invalid, because a minimal NP with multiple adjectives all modifying the head noun is far more common than a minimal NP with multiple adjectives where one of them modifies another.
    Furthermore, minimal NPs with multiple adjectives are relatively rare in the first place; most minimal NPs consist simply of a noun or an adjective and a noun.
    The resulting adjective-adjective and adjectivenoun pairs are filtered by a morphology component, which removes pairs that contain erroneous information (such as mistyped words, proper names, and closed-class words which may be mistakenly classified as adjectives (e.g. possessive pronouns)).
    This component also reduces the number of different pairs without losing information by transforming words to an equivalent, base form (e.g. plural nouns are converted to singular) so that the expected and actual fr
