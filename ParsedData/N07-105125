SJ data.
    Fig.
    4 shows the performance on the Brown corpus during hierarchical training.
    While the FI score on the WSJ is rising we observe a drop in performance after the 5th iteration, suggesting that some overfitting is occurring.
  
  
    The coarse-to-fine scheme presented here, in conjunction with the risk-appropriate parse selection methodology, allows fast, accurate parsing, in multiple languages and domains.
    For training, one needs only a raw context-free treebank and for decoding one needs only a final grammar, along with coarsening maps.
    The final parser is publicly available at http://www.nlp.cs.berkeley.edu.
