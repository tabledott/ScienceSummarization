    In this grammar, a special empty element is defined corresponding to the missing verb.
    All information on the verb in second position is percolated through the rules to this empty verb.
    Therefore the definition of the several VP rules is valid for both root and subordinate clauses.7 The problem comes about because the generator can (and must) at some point predict the empty verb as the pivot of the construction.
    However, in the definition of this empty verb no information (such as the list of compleme
