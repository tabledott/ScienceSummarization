d Kay 1981).
    The mathematical analysis in terms of regular relations emerged somewhat later.
    Aspects of that analysis and its extension to two-level systems were presented at conferences by Kaplan (1984, 1985, 1988), in courses at the 1987 and 1991 Linguistics Institutes, and at colloquia at Stanford University, Brown University, the University of Rochester, and the University of Helsinki.
    Our approach differs from Johnson's in two important ways.
    First, we abstract away from the many details of both notation and machine description that are crucial to Johnson's method of argumentation.
    Instead, we rely strongly on closure properties in the underlying algebra of regular relations to establish the major result that phonological rewriting systems denote such sets of string-pairs.
    We then use the correspondence between regular relations and finite-state transducers to develop a constructive relationship between rewriting rules and transducers.
    This is accomplished by means of a small
