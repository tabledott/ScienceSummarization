	Efficient Parsing Of Highly Ambiguous Context-Free Grammars With Bit Vectors
		An efficient bit-vector-based CKY-style parser for context-free parsing is presented.
		The parser computes a compact parse forest representation of the complete set of possible analyses forlarge treebank grammars and long input sen tences.
		The parser uses bit-vector operations to parallelise the basic parsing operations.
		The parser is particularly useful when all analyses are needed rather than just the most probable one.
	
	
			Large context-free grammars extracted from tree banks achieve high coverage and accuracy, but they are difficult to parse with because of their massive ambiguity.
			The application of standard chart-parsing techniques often fails due to excessive memory and runtime requirements.Treebank grammars are mostly used as probabilis tic grammars and users are usually only interested in the best analysis, the Viterbi parse.
			To speed up Viterbi parsing, sophisticated search strategies havebeen developed wh
