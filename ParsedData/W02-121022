    Figures 1 and 2 show the performance of PET parsing of hand-made and real data, respectively.
    One characteristic of real-world data is the variety of punctuation marks that occur and the potential for ambiguity that they bring.
    In our grammar, certain punctuation marks are given lexical entries and processed by grammar rules.
    Take, for example, quotation marks.
    Ignoring them (as done in most development-oriented grammars and smaller grammars), leads to a significant loss of structural information: 'Someone said: &#8220;push the button.

    Since the phrase before to is a complete sentence, this string is ambiguous if one ignores the quotation marks.
    With the quotation marks, however, only the complementizer to is possible.
    Given the high degree of ambiguity inherent in broadcoverage grammars, we have found it extremely useful to parse punctuation rather than ig
