			So far, 500 abstracts are annotated and converted to the merged PTB format.
			In the merg ing process, we found several annotation errors.
			The 500 abstracts with correction of these errors are made publicly available as ?The GENIA Treebank Beta Version?
			(GTB-beta).
			For further clean-up, we also tried to parse the corpus by the Enju parser (Miyao and Tsujii 2004), and identify the error of the corpus by investigating into the parse errors.
			Enju is an HPSG parser that can be trained with PTB-type corpora which is reported to have 87% accuracy on Wall Street Journal portion of Penn Treebank corpus.
			Currently the accuracy of the parser drops down to 82% on GTB-beta, and although proper quantitative analysis is yet to be done, it was found that the mismatches between labels of the treebank and the GENIA POS corpus (e.g. an ?ing form labeled as noun in the POS corpus and as the head of a verb phrase in t
