gorithm can simply find the highest-probability parse for each nonterminal for each substring of the input sentence.
    No lower-probability subtrees will ever be used in a complete parse, and they can be thrown away.
    Recent lexicalized stochastic parsers such as Collins (1999), Charniak (1997), and others add additional features to each constituent, the most important being the head word of the parse constituent.
    The statistical system for assigning semantic roles described in the previous sections does not fit easily into the chart-parsing framework, as it relies on long-distance dependencies between the target word and its frame elements.
    In particular, the path feature, which is used to &#8220;navigate&#8221; through the sentence from the target word to its likely frame elements, may be an arbitrarily long sequence of syntactic constituents.
    A path feature looking for frame elements for a target word in another part of the sentence may examine the internal structure of a constituent, viol
