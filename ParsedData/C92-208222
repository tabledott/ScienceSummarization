  We wrote grammar  ules for the constituent analyzer to recognize the pattern in ( la) .
  As mentioned above, in this experiment we are detecting only unmodified nouns.
  Therefore, when a noun is found in the hyper- nym position, that is, before the lexemes "such as", we check for the nouns inclusion in a relative clause, or as part of a larger noun phrase that includes an appositive or a parenthetical.
  Using tile constituent analyzer, it is not necessary to parse the entire sell- tence; instead we look at just enough local context around the iexical items in the pattern to ensure that tile nouns in tile pattern are isolated.
  After the hypernym is detected the hyponyms are identified.
  Often they occur ill a llst and each ele- ment ill the list holds a hyponym relation with the hypernym.
  The main difficulty here lies m determin- ing the extent of the last term in the list.
