ff, 2006) used a language model and stochastic grammar to replace prepositions removed from a dialogue corpus.
    Even though they reported a precision of 0.88 and recall of 0.78, their evaluation was on a very restricted domain with only a limited number of prepositions, nouns and verbs.
  
  
    A preposition error can be a case of incorrect preposition selection (They arrived to the town), use of a preposition in a context where it is prohibited (They came to inside), or failure to use a preposition in a context where it is obligatory (e.g., He is fond this book).
    To detect the first type of error, incorrect selection, we have employed a maximum entropy (ME) model to estimate the probability of each of 34 prepositions, based on the features in their local contexts.
    The ME Principle says that the best model will satisfy the constraints found in the training, and for those situations not covered in the training, the best model will assume a distribution of maximum entropy.
    This approach has bee
