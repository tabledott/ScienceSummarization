adratic kernel K(xi, xj) = (?xTi xj + r)2 and LIBSVM?s builtin one-versus-one strategy for multi-class classifica tion, converting symbolic features to numerical ones using the standard technique of binarization.
			As our baseline settings, we used ? = 0.2 and r = 0 forthe kernel parameters, C = 0.5 for the penalty para meter, and ? = 1.0 for the termination criterion.
			In order to reduce training times during development, we also split the training data for each language intosmaller sets and trained separate multi-class classi fiers for each set, using the POSTAG of Next as the defining feature for the split.
			The time spent on optimizing learning algorithm parameters varies between languages, mainly due to lack of time.
			For Arabic, Basque, and Catalan, the baseline settings were used also in the dry run and final test.
