ications for bilingual correspondence information have been suggested.
    They can be used in bilingual concordances, for automatically constructing bilingual lexicons, and probabilistically quantified correspondences may be useful for statistical translation methods.
  
  
    Figure 1 illustrates how the corpus is analyzed.
    The words in sentences are first tagged with their corresponding part-of-speech categories.
    Each tagger contains a hidden Markov model (HMM), which is trained using samples of raw text from the Hansards for each language.
    The taggers are robust and operate with a low error rate [Kupiec, 19921.
    Simple noun phrases (excluding pronouns and digits) are then extracted from the sentences by finite-state recognizers that are specified by regular expressions defined in terms of part-ofspeech categories.
    Simple noun phrases are identified because they are most reliably recognized; it is also assumed that they can be identified unambiguously.
    The only embedding that is all
