    This paper is an expanded version of a preliminary paper that appeared in the Proceedings of the 1999 Joint SIGDAT Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Very Large Corpora.
    We would like to thank the MUC organizers who made available to us the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets, without which this work would have been impossible.
    We also thank Beth Sundheim for helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper, and Hai Leong Chieu for his implementation of the HMM-based named entity recognition module.
