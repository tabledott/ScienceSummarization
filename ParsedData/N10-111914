ns and many are morphological variants of the same root, e.g., excel/excels/excelled.
    The algorithm produced a lexicon that contained 178,104 entries.
    Depending on the threshold -y (see Figure 1), this lexicon could be larger or smaller.
    As stated earlier, our selection of -y and all hyperparameters was based on manual inspection of the resulting lexicons and performance on held-out data.
    In the rest of this section we investigate the properties of this lexicon to understand both its general characteristics as well as its possible utility in sentiment applications.
    To this end we compare three different lexicons: Table 1 breaks down the lexicon by the number of positive and negative entries of each lexicon, which clearly shows that the lexicon derived from the web is more than an order of magnitude larger than previously constructed lexicons.2 This in and of itself is not much of an achievement if the additional phrases are of poor quality.
    However, in Section 3.2 we present an empiric
