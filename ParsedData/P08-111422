VP variants seem to do generally well in both languages.
    This makes sense, since &#8212; at least for these language pairs and perhaps more generally &#8212; clauses and verb phrases seem to correspond often on the source and target side.
    We found it more surprising that no NP variant yielded much gain in Arabic; this question will be taken up in future work.
  
  
    Space limitations preclude a thorough review of work attempting to navigate the tradeoff between using language analyzers and exploiting unconstrained data-driven modeling, although the recent literature is full of variety and promising approaches.
    We limit ourselves here to several approaches that seem most closely related.
    Among approaches using parser-based syntactic models, several researchers have attempted to reduce the strictness of syntactic constraints in order to better exploit shallow correspondences in parallel training data.
    Our introduction has already briefly noted Cowan et al. (2006), who relax parse-tree-bas
