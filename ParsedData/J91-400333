tructures, together with the semantic distinction made above between the two object types, provides us with an explanation for what I will refer to as the logical polysemy of verbs such as bake.
    As illustrated in Example 30a, when the verb takes as its complement a natural kind such as potato, the resulting semantic interpretation is unchanged; i.e., a process reading of a state-change.
    This is because the noun does not &amp;quot;project&amp;quot; an event structure of its own.
    That is, relative to the process of baking, potato does not denote an event-type.12 What is it, then, about the semantics of cake that shifts this core meaning of bake from a state-change predicate to its creation sense?
    As just suggested, this additional meaning is contributed by specific lexical knowledge we have about artifacts, and cake in particular; namely, there is an event associated with that object's &amp;quot;coming into being,&amp;quot; in this case the process of baking.
    Thus, just as a verb can select
