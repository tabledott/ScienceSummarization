arser is also evaluated on DepBank and compared against the RASP parser, outperforming RASP overall and on the majority of relation types.
    The evaluation on DepBank raises a number of issues regarding parser evaluation.
    This article provides a comprehensive blueprint for building a wide-coverage CCG parser.
    We demonstrate that both accurate and highly efficient parsing is possible with CCG.
  
  
    This article describes a number of log-linear parsing models for an automatically extracted lexicalized grammar.
    The models are &#8220;full&#8221; parsing models in the sense that probabilities are defined for complete parses, rather than for independent events derived by decomposing the parse tree.
    Discriminative training is used to estimate the models, which requires incorrect parses for each sentence in the training data as well as the correct parse.
    The lexicalized grammar formalism used is Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), and the grammar is automatically extracted from CCGbank, a
