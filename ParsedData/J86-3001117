vious generalizations.
    Although, like those generalizations, it supplies the principal framework for discourse segmentation and determines structural relationships for the focusing structure (part of the attentional state), unlike its predecessors it does not depend on the special details of any single domain or type of discourse.
    Although admittedly still incomplete, the theory does provide a solid basis for investigating both the structure and meaning of discourse, as well as for constructing discourse-processing systems.
    Several difficult research problems remain to be explored.
    Of these, we take the following to be of primary importance: Finally, the theory suggests several important conjectures.
    First, that a discourse is coherent only when its discourse purpose is shared by all the participants and when each utterance of the discourse contributes to achieving this purpose, either directly or indirectly, by contributing to the satisfaction of a discourse segment purpose.
    Second, g
