st experiment and of the coreferent class in the second experiment we can estimate that approximately 15% of definite descriptions are coreferential and have a different head from their antecedents.
    4.4.2 Agreement among Annotators.
    The agreement among annotators in Experiment 2 was not very high: 61% total agreement, which gives K = 0.58 or K = 0.63, depending on whether we consider doubts as a class.'
    This value is worse than the one we obtained in Experiment 1 (K = 0.68 or K = 0.73); in fact, this value of K goes below the level at which we can tentatively assume agreement among the annotators.
    There could be several reasons for the fact that agreement got worse in this second experiment.
    Perhaps the simplest explanation is that we were just using more classes.
    In order to check whether this was the case, we merged the classes larger situation and unfamiliar back into one class, as we had in the Experiment 1: that is, we recomputed K after counting all definite descriptions classifi
