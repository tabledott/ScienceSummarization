cannot be created from what is already there.
    Not every verb modified by a particle may be a genuine multiword unit, but may instead be a fully compositional verb modified by an adverbial e.g. fly up.
    Also very productive verb particle combinations such as those involving verbs of motion, which often occur with a particle e.g. up, such as wander, stroll, go etc... might be better handled in the grammar (Villavicencio and Copestake, 2002).
    Additionally, in lexical acquisition, and for word sense disambiguation, it is important that related senses of words are identified.
    For example, if the verb eat is closer in meaning to a phrasal construction eat up, compared to other simplex verbs with their phrasal constructions such as blow/blow up, then the lexicon should reflect that.
    Having a measure of compositionality should help in this.
    In this paper we are not concerned with evaluation of precision and recall of the extraction of phrasal verbs from a parser, although we have done some prel
