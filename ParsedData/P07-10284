 predicate p as where the c are WordNet synsets.
    The preference that rp has for a given synset c0, the selectional association between the two, is then defined as the contribution of c0 to rp's selectional preference strength: Further WordNet-based approaches to selectional preference induction include Clark and Weir (2001), and Abe and Li (1993).
    Brockmann and Lapata (2003) perform a comparison of WordNet-based models.
    Rooth et al. (1999) generalize over seen headwords using EM-based clustering rather than WordNet.
    They model the probability of a word w occurring as the argument rp of a predicate p as being independently conditioned on a set of classes C: 'We write rp to indicate predicate-specific roles, like &#8220;the direct object of catch&#8221;, rather than just &#8220;obj&amp;quot;.
    The parameters P(c), P(rp|c) and P(w|c) are estimated using the EM algorithm.
    While there have been no isolated comparisons of the two generalization paradigms that we are aware of, Gildea and Juraf
