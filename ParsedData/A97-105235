 system (as developed so far) and to provide empirical feedback for further development, we took the Susanne, SEC (Taylor &amp; Knowles, 1988) and LOB corpora (Garside et at., 1987)&#8212;a total of 1.2 million words&#8212;and extracted all sentences containing an occurrence of one of fourteen verbs, up to a maximum of 1000 citations of each.
    These verbs, listed in Figure 2, were chosen at random, subject to the constraint that they exhibited multiple complementation patterns.
    The sentences containing these verbs were tagged and parsed automatically, and the extractor, classifier and evaluator were applied to the resulting The binomial distribution gives the probability of an event with probability p happening exactly m times out of n attempts: successful analyses.
    The citations from which entries were derived totaled approximately 70K words.
    The results were evaluated against a merged entry for these verbs from the ANLT and COMLEX Syntax dictionaries, and also against a manual analysis of the
