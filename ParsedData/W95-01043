l checkers, which can only detect errors that result in non-words.
    We start by applying a very simple method to the task, to serve as a baseline for comparison with the other methods.
    We then apply each of the two component methods mentioned above &#8212; context words and collocations.
    We try two ways of combining these components: decision lists, and Bayesian classifiers.
    We evaluate the above methods by comparing them with an alternative approach to spelling correction based on part-of-speech trigra.ms.
    The sections below discuss the task of context-sensitive spelling correction, the five methods we tried for the task (baseline, two component methods, and two hybrid methods), and the evaluation.
    The final section draws some conclusions.
  
  
    Context-sensitive spelling correction is the problem of correcting spelling errors that result in valid words in the lexicon.
    Such errors can arise for a variety of reasons, including typos (e.g., out for our), homonym confusions (there
