    Rationale.
    To update the old forward/inner probabilities a and -y to a' and -y', respectively, the probabilities of all paths expanding Y v have to be factored in.
    These are exactly the paths summarized by the inner probability -y&amp;quot;.
    The standard Earley algorithm, together with the probability computations described in the previous section, would be sufficient if it weren't for the problem of recursion in the prediction and completion steps.
    The nonprobabilistic Earley algorithm can stop recursing as soon as all predictions/completions yield states already contained in the current state set.
    For the computation of probabilities, however, this would mean truncating the probabilities resulting from the repeated summing of contributions.
