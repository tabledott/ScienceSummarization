lies on morphological information and a part-of-speech tagging.
    Many of the rules identified by the algorithm match those that have been described as productive paraphrases in the linguistic literature.
    In the following sections, we provide an overview of existing work on paraphrasing, then we describe data used in this work, and detail our paraphrase extraction technique.
    We present results of our evaluation, and conclude with a discussion of our results.
  
  
    Many NLP applications are required to deal with the unlimited variety of human language in expressing the same information.
    So far, three major approaches of collecting paraphrases have emerged: manual collection, utilization of existing lexical resources and corpus-based extraction of similar words.
    Manual collection of paraphrases is usually used in generation (Iordanskaja et al., 1991; Robin, 1994).
    Paraphrasing is an inevitable part of any generation task, because a semantic concept can be realized in many different way
