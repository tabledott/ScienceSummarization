ult also holds for any arbitrary Markovization.
  
  
    In this paper we have shown that many important learning and inference problems can be solved efficiently for non-projective edge-factored dependency models by appealing to the Matrix Tree Theorem for multi-digraphs.
    These results extend the work of McDonald et al. (2005b) and help to further our understanding of when exact non-projective algorithms can be employed.
    When this analysis is coupled with the projective parsing algorithms of Eisner (1996) and Paskin (2001) we begin to get a clear picture of the complexity for data-driven dependency parsing within an edge-factored framework.
    To further justify the algorithms presented here, we outlined a few novel learning and inference settings in which they are required.
    However, for the non-projective case, moving beyond edge-factored models will almost certainly lead to intractable parsing problems.
    We have provided further evidence for this by proving the hardness of incorporating ar
