s relatively hard.5 Should we expect the next word to be easier than interest or harder than interest?
    One might ask if 70% is good or bad.
    In fact, both Black (1988) and Yarowsky (1992) report 72% performance on this very same word.
    Although it is dangerous to compare such results since there are many potentially important differences (e.g., corpora, judges, etc.
    ), it appears that Zernik's 70% figure is fairly representative of the state of the art.6 Should we be happy with 70% performance?
    In fact, 70% really isn't very good.
    Recall that Bar-Hillel (1960, p. 159) abandoned the machine translation field when he couldn't see how a machine could possibly do a decent job in translating text if it couldn't do better than this in disambiguating word senses.
    Bar-Hillel's real objection was an empirical one.
    Using his numbers,7 it appears that programs, at the time, could disambiguate only about 75% of the words in a sentence (e.g., 15 out of 20).
    If interest is a relatively eas
