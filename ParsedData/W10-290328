rning approaches.
    The DIRECT and AGGRESSIVE approaches use binary feedback to learn, however they utilize the signal differently.
    DIRECT uses the signal directly to learn a binary classifier capable of replicating the feedback, whereas AGGRESSIVE learns a structured predictor that can repeatedly obtain the logical forms for which positive feedback was received.
    Thus, although the AGGRESSIVE outperforms the DIRECT approach the concepts each approach learns may be different.
    Analysis over the training data shows that in 66.8% examples both approaches predict a logical form that gives the correct answer.
    While AGGRESSIVE correctly answers an additional 16% which DIRECT gets incorrect.
    In the opposite direction, DIRECT correctly answers 8.8% that AGGRESSIVE does not.
    Leaving only 8.4% of the examples that both approaches predict incorrect logical forms.
    This suggests that an approach which combines DIRECT and AGGRESSIVE may be able to improve even further.
