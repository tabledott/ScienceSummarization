considered for merging.
    Because they are singleton classes, there is no additional possibility for conflict, and both noun phrases are merged into cl.
    We developed and evaluated the clustering approach to coreference resolution using the &amp;quot;dry run&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;formal evaluation&amp;quot; MUC-6 coreference corpora.
    Each corpus contains 30 documents that have been annotated with NP coreference links.
    We used the dryrun data for development of the distance measure and selection of the clustering radius r and reserved the formal evaluation materials for testing.
    All results are reported using the standard measures of recall and precision or F-measure (which combines recall and precision equally).
    They were calculated automatically using the MUC-6 scoring program (Vilain et al., 1995).
    Table 4 summarizes our results and compares them to three baselines.
    For each algorithm, we show the F-measure for the dryrun evaluation (column 2) and the formal evaluation (column
