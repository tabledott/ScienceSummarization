tic components and of source and target grammars and lexicons.
    Our conceptual framework depends on notions of structure, structural description, and structural correspondence.
    In the following sections we outline these basic notions and show how they can be used to deal with certain interesting translation problems in a simple and straightforward way.
    In its emphasis on description-based techniques, our approach shares some fundamental features with the one proposed by Kay (1984), but we use an explicit projection mechanism to separate out and organize the intra- and inter-language components.
    Most existing translation systems are either transfer-based or interlingua-based Transfer-based systems usually specify a single level of representation or abstraction at which transfer is supposed to take place.
    A source string is analyzed into a structure at that level of representation, a transfer program then converts this into a target structure at the same level, and the target string is then g
