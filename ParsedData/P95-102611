ditional partitioning collocations from cooccurrence with previously-identified ones is illustrated in the lower portion of Figure 2.
    STEP 3c: Optionally, the one-sense-per-discourse constraint is then used both to filter and augment this addition.
    The details of this process are discussed in Section 7.
    In brief, if several instances of the polysemous word in a discourse have already been assigned SENSE-A, this sense tag may be extended to all examples in the discourse, conditional on the relative numbers and the probabilities associated with the tagged examples.
    This augmentation of the training data can often form a bridge to new collocations that may not otherwise co-occur in the same nearby context with previously identified collocations.
    Such a bridge to the SENSE-A collocate &amp;quot;cell&amp;quot; is illustrated graphically in the upper half of Figure 2.
    Similarly, the one-sense-per-discourse constraint may also be used to correct erroneously labeled examples.
    For example:
