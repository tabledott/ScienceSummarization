ese models fall short as a solution to the credit attribution problem.
    Because labels have meaning to the people that assigned them, a simple solution to the credit attribution problem is to assign a document&#8217;s words to its labels rather than to a latent and possibly less interpretable semantic space.
    This paper presents Labeled LDA (L-LDA), a generative model for multiply labeled corpora that marries the multi-label supervision common to modern text datasets with the word-assignment ambiguity resolution of the LDA family of models.
    In contrast to standard LDA and its existing supervised variants, our model associates each label with one topic in direct correspondence.
    In the following section, L-LDA is shown to be a natural extension of both LDA (by incorporating supervision) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (by incorporating a mixture model).
    We demonstrate that L-LDA can go a long way toward solving the credit attribution problem in multiply labeled documents with improved interpretabi
