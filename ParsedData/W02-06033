new words appear and grammatical changes take place.
    Consequently, it is important to develop methods that are able to discover a morphology for a language based on unsupervised analysis of large amounts of data.
    As the morphology discovery from untagged corpora is a computationally hard problem, in practice one must make some assumptions about the structure of words.
    The appropriate specific assumptions are somewhat language-dedependent.
    For example, for English it may be useful to assume that words consist of a stem, often followed by a suffix and possibly preceded by a prefix.
    By contrast, a Finnish word typically consists of a stem followed by multiple suffixes.
    In addition, compound words are common, containing an alternation of stems and suffixes, e.g., the word kahvinjuojallekin (Engl.

    Moreover, one may ask, whether a morphologically complex word exhibits some hierarchical structure, or whether it is merely
