 These systems are similar to those described by Pollard (1984) as Generalized Context-Free Grammars (GCFG's).
    Unlike GCFG's, however, the composition operations of LCFRS's are restricted to be linear (do not duplicate unboundedly large structures) and nonerasing (do not erase unbounded structures, a restriction made in most modern transformational grammars).
    These two restrictions impose the constraint that the result of composing any two structures should be a structure whose &amp;quot;size&amp;quot; is the sum of its constituents plus some constant For example, the operation 4, discussed in the case of CFG's (in Section 4.1) adds the constant equal to the sum of the length of the strings VI, un+r&#8226; Since we are considering formalisms with arbitrary structures it is difficult to precisely specify all of the restrictions on the composition operations that we believe would appropriately generalize the concatenation operation for the particular structures used by the formalism.
