tion are very similar to those that come up in logic programming.
    One can actually use the feature system for certain kind of inferencing.
    For example, let Mary, Jane, and John have the following values:
  
  
    straints rather than additional features for establishing a markedness hierarchy.
    For example, the following feature specifications have the effect that we seek.
    If we now unify John with [sister: [eyes: blue]] both Jane and Mary get marked with the positive constraint that at least one of them has blue eyes.
    Suppose that we now learn that Mary has green eyes.
    This immediately gives us more information about John and Jane as well.
    Now we know that Jane's eyes are blue and that she definitely is John's sister.
    The role of positive constraints is to keep track of partial information in such a way that no inconsistencies are allowed and proper updating is done when more things become known.
