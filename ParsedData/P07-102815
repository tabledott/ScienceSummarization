to use two vector spaces, backing off to the denser one for words not covered by the sparse but highly accurate space used in this paper.
    Parameters of similarity-based models.
    Besides the similarity metric itself, which we discuss below, parameters of the similarity-based models include the number of seen headwords, the weighting scheme, and the number of similar words for each headword.
    Table 4 breaks down error rates by semantic role frequency band for two of the similaritybased models, micro-averaging over roles of the same frequency band and over cross-validation runs.
    As the table shows, there was some variation across frequency bands, but not as much as between models.
    The question of the number of seen headwords necessary to compute selectional preferences is further explored in Figure 1.
    The figure charts the number of seen headwords against error rate for a Jaccard similarity-based model (uniform weights).
    As can be seen, error rates reach a plateau at about 25 seen headw
