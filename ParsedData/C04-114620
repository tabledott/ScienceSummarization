the frequency of the hypernymic term is greater than that of the hyponymicterm.
			In order to test these hypotheses, we ex tracted all of the possible hyponym-hypernym pairs (20, 415 pairs in total) from our list of 2000 nouns (using WordNet 1.6).
			We then calculatedthe proportion for which the direction of the hy ponymy relation could be accurately predicted by the relative values of precision and recall andthe proportion for which the direction of the hy ponymy relation could be accurately predictedby relative frequency.
			We found that the direc tion of the hyponymy relation is correlated in the predicted direction with the precision-recall 1There may be other concepts in the hypernym chain between dog and animal e.g. carnivore and mammal.values in 71% of cases and correlated in the pre dicted direction with relative frequency in 70% of cases.
			This supports the idea of a three-waylinking between distributional generality, rela tive frequency and semantic generality.
