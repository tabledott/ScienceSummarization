acilitate further the mapping of syntactic relations and to avoid errors due to fine distinctions between them, we grouped related syntactic relations into a single &amp;quot;general class&amp;quot; and mapped this class to the target language.
    The important classes used were relations between a verb and its arguments and modifiers (counting as one class all objects, indirect objects, complements, and nouns in modifying prepositional phrases) and between a noun and its arguments and modifiers (counting as one class all modifying nouns in compounds and nouns in modifying prepositional phrases).
    The classification enables us to get more statistical data for each class, as it reduces the number of relations.
    The success of using this general level of syntactic relations indicates that even a rough mapping of source to target language relations is useful for the statistical model.
    We now wish to determine the plausibility of each alternative target word being the translation of an ambiguous source
