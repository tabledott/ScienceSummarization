t not usually in en tirety, and the strictness of the isomorphism may vary across words or syntactic rules.
			The idea is that, rather than a synchronous structure over the source and target sentences, a tree over the target sentence is modeled by a source-sentence-specific grammar that is inspired by the source sentence?s tree.1 This is implemented by a ?sense??really just a subsetof nodes in the source tree?attached to each gram mar node in the target tree.
			The senses define an alignment between the trees.
			Because it only loosely links the two sentences?
			syntactic structure, QG is particularly well-suited for QA insofar as QA is like ?free?
			translation.
			A concrete example that is easy to understand is a binary quasi-synchronous context-free grammar 1Smith and Eisner also show how QG formalisms generalize synchronous grammar formalisms.(denoted QCFG).
			Let VS be the set of constituent to kens in the source tree.
			QCFG rules would take the augmented form ?X, S1?
			?Y, S2??Z, S3?
			?X, S1
