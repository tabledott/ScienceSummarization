al adequacy of Pereira's proposal) still remain open, but the mechanism sketched does provide plausible results for a number of examples.
    The final logical form produced by Gemini is the result of applying a set of quantifier scoping rules to the best interpretation chosen by the parse preference mechanism.
    The semantic rules build quasi-logical forms, which contain complete semantic predicate-argument structure, but do not specify quantifier scoping.
    The scoping algorithm that we use combines syntactic and semantic information with a set of quantifier scoping preference rules to rank the possible scoped logical forms consistent with the quasi-logical form selected by parse preferences.
    This algorithm is described in detail in (Moran, 1988).
  
  
    In our approach to resolving the tension between overgeneration and robustness in a spoken language understanding system, some aspects of Gemini are specifically oriented towards limiting overgeneration, such as the on-line property for the parse
