., English) is not resourceimpoverished.
    How might we exploit English parsers to improve syntactic analysis tools for this language?
    One idea (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Hwa et al., 2002) is to project English analysis onto L data, &#8220;through&#8221; word-aligned parallel text.
    To do this, we might use an English parser to analyze the English side of the parallel text and a word-alignment algorithm to induce word correspondences.
    By positing a coupling of English syntax with L syntax, we can induce structure on the L side of the parallel text that is in some sense isomorphic to the English parse.
    We might take the projection idea a step farther.
    A statistical English parser can tell us much more than the hypothesized best parse.
    It can be used to find every parse admitted by a grammar, and also scores of those parses.
    Similarly, translation models, which yield word alignments, can be used in principle to score competing alignments and offer alternatives to a single-best alignm
