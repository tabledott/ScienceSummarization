se disambiguation.
    The work reported here is the first to take advantage of this regularity in conjunction with separate models of local context for each word.
    Importantly, I do not use one-sense-per-discourse as a hard constraint; it affects the classification probabilistically and can be overridden when local evidence is strong.
    In this current work, the one-sense-per-discourse hypothesis was tested on a set of 37,232 examples (hand-tagged over a period of 3 years), the same data studied in the disambiguation experiments.
    For these words, the table below measures the claim's accuracy (when the word occurs more than once in a discourse, how often it takes on the majority sense for the discourse) and applicability (how often the word does occur more than once in a discourse).
    Clearly, the claim holds with very high reliability for these words, and may be confidently exploited as another source of evidence in sense tagging.'
