whose associated history-view can be considered to be either on or off for a given token.
    Examples are &amp;quot;the token begins with a capitalized letter&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the token is a four-digit number&amp;quot;.
    Equation I gives an example of a binary feature.
    The 11 binary history-views used by MENE's binary features are very similar to those used in BBN's Nymble/Identifinder system (Bikel et al., 1997) with two exceptions: b, when the (history,future) space on which feature b activates must be a subset of the space for feature a, it can be shown that the M.E. model will yield the same results whether a and b are included as features or if (a &#8212; b) and b are features.
    Consequently, MENE allows all features to fire in overlapping cases.
    For instance, in MENE the initial cap features activate on the histories &amp;quot;Clinton&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;IBM&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;ValuJet&amp;quot; while in Nymble the feature would only be active on &amp;quot;Clinton&amp;quot; be
