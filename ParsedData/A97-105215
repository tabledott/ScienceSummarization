    We randomly selected a test set of 250 in-coverage sentences (of lengths 3-56 tokens, mean 18.2) from the Susanne treebank, retagged with possibly multiple tags per word, and measured the 'baseline' accuracy of the unlexicalized parser on the sentences using the now standard PARSEVAL/GEIG evaluation metrics of mean crossing brackets per sentence and (unlabelled) bracket recall and precision (e.g.
