s to simpler surface ones for generic multi-document summarization.
    In this work we examine a series of content models for multi-document summarization and argue that LDA-style probabilistic topic models (Blei et al., 2003) can offer state-of-the-art summarization quality as measured by automatic metrics (see section 5.1) and manual user evaluation (see section 5.2).
    We also contend that they provide convenient building blocks for adding more structure to a summarization model.
    In particular, we utilize a variation of the hierarchical LDA topic model (Blei et al., 2004) to discover multiple specific &#8216;subtopics&#8217; within a document set.
    The resulting model, HIERSUM (see section 3.4), can produce general summaries as well as summaries for any of the learned sub-topics.
  
  
    The task we will consider is extractive multidocument summarization.
    In this task we assume a document collection D consisting of documents Di, ... , D,,, describing the same (or closely related) narrative
