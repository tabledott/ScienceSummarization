ship and generally produces a lower accuracy.
    There are patterns of diathesis behaviour among verb groups (Levin, 1993).
    Accuracy may be improved by considering several alternations collectively, rather than in isolation.
    Complementary techniques to identify alternations, for example (Resnik, 1993), might be combined with ours.
    Although we have reported results on only two RSAS, our method is applicable to other such alternations.
    Furthermore, such application requires no human endeavour, apart from that required for evaluation.
    However, a considerably larger corpus would be required to overcome the sparse data problem for other RSA alternations.
