andidates (Hovy et al, 2001; Ittycheriah et al, 2001) based on some categorization of answer types.
			This work develops a machine learning approach to question classification (QC) (Harabagiu et al, 2001; Hermjakob, 2001).
			Our goal is to categorize questions into different semantic classes that impose constraints on potential answers, so that they can be utilized in later stages of the question answeringprocess.
			For example, when considering the question Q: What Canadian city has the largest popula tion?, the hope is to classify this question as havinganswer type city, implying that only candidate an swers that are cities need consideration.Based on the SNoW learning architecture, we develop a hierarchical classifier that is guided by a lay ered semantic hierarchy of answer types and is able to classify questions into fine-grained classes.
			Wesuggest that it is useful to consider this classifica tion task as a multi-label classification and find that it is possible to achieve good classification resu
