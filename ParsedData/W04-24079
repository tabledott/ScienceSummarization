tion of the parser.
			However, in order to maintain the efficiency of the parser, the classifier must also be implemented in such a way that each transition can still be performed in constant time.Previous work in this area includes the use of memory based learning to guide a standard shift-reduce parser(Veenstra and Daelemans, 2000) and the use of support vector machines to guide a deterministic depen dency parser (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003).
			In theexperiments reported in this paper, we apply memory based learning within a deterministic dependency parsing framework.
			2.4 Memory-Based Learning.
			Memory-based learning and problem solving is based ontwo fundamental principles: learning is the simple stor age of experiences in memory, and solving a new problem is achieved by reusing solutions from similar previously solved problems (Daelemans, 1999).
			It is inspired by thenearest neighbor approach in statistical pattern recogni tion and artificial intelligence (Fix and Hodges, 1952), as well as the an
