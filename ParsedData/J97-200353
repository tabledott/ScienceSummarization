llows transducers outputting pairs of strings and weights to be determined.
    The determirtization algorithm for such transducers is illustrated in Figures 13 and 14.
    Subsets in this algorithm are made of triples (q, w, x) E Q x E* U { oo} x R. U foo}, where q is a state of the initial transducer, w a residual string, and x a residual output weight.
    We here define a minimization algorithm for subsequential power series defined on the tropical semiring, which extends the algorithm defined by Mohri (1994b) in the case of string-to-string transducers.
    For any subset L of E* and any string u we define it-lL by: 11 One can prove that S. a power series defined on a field, is rational if it admits a finite number of independent u-1S (Carlyle and Paz 1971).
    This is the equivalent, for power series, of Nerode's theorem for regular languages.
    Mohri Transducers in Language and Speech For any subsequential power series S we can now define the following relation on E*: It is easy to show that Rs is a
