    For similar reasons, any two applications in a derivation where the rules involved have more than one segment in their left-hand sides, one and only one of the two following situations arises: If one follows to the letter the definitions in this section, then checking, in a parsing procedure, whether an XG rule may be applied, would require a scan of the whole intermediate string.
    However, we will see in Section 10 that this check may be done &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot; as brackets are introduced, with a cost independent of the length of the current intermediate string in the derivation.
  
  
    In the same way as parse trees are used to visualise context-free derivations, I use derivation graphs to represent XG derivations.
    In a derivation graph, as in a parse tree, each node corresponds to a rule application or to a terminal symbol in the derived sentence, and the edges leaving a node correspond to the symbols in the right-hand side of that node's rule.
    In a derivation graph, how
