isting of input words and their translations.
    For some applications, it is insufficient to guess only the single most likely translation of each word in the input.
    The model is expected to output the whole distribution of possible translations for each input word.
    This distribution is then combined with other distributions that are relevant to the application.
    For example, for cross-language information retrieval, the translational distribution can be combined with the distribution of term frequencies.
    For statistical machine translation, the translational distribution can be decoded with a source language model (Brown et al. 1988; Al-Onaizan et al.
    1999).
    To predict how the different models might perform in such applications, the whole distribution task was to generate a whole set of links from each input word, weighted according to the probability assigned by the model to each of the input word's translations.
    Each model was tested on this task with and without function words
