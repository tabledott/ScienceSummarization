    For every application of a rule set to a word, we computed the precision and recall, and then using the total number of guessed words we computed the coverage.
    We noticed certain regularities in the behavior of the metrics in response to the change of the threshold: recall improves as the threshold increases while coverage drops proportionally.
    This is not surprising: the higher the threshold, the fewer the inaccurate rules included in the rule set, but at the same time the fewer the words that can be handled.
    An interesting behavior is shown by precision: first, it grows proportionally along with the increase of the threshold, but then, at high thresholds, it decreases.
    This means that among very confident rules with very high scores, there are many quite general ones.
    The best thresholds were obtained in the range of 70-80 points.
    Table 3 displays the metrics for the best-scored (by aggregate of the three metrics on the training and the test samples) rule sets.
