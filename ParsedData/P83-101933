ered the selfcorrection component from the standpoint of parsing.
    However, it is clear that the origins are in the process of generation.
    The mechanism for editing self-corrections that I have proposed has as its essential operation expunging one of two identical elements.
    It is unable to expunge a sequence of two elements.
    (The Surface Copy Editor might be viewed as a counterexample to this claim, but see below.)
    Consider expunction now from the standpoint of the generator.
    Suppose self-correction bears a one-to-one relationship to a possible action of the generator (initiated by some monitoring component) which could be called ABANDON CONSTRUCT X.
    And suppose that this action can be initiated at any time up until CONSTRUCT X is completed, when a signal is returned that the construction is complete.
    Further suppose that ABANDON CONSTRUCT X causes an editing signal.
    When the speaker decides in the middle of some linguistic element to abandon it and start again, an editing s
