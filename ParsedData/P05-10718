results are much worse than in our resource-rich approach.
    Darwish (2003) discusses unsupervised identification of roots; as mentioned above, we leave root identification to future work.
  
  
    The data we use comes from the Penn Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004).
    Like the English Penn Treebank, the corpus is a collection of news texts.
    Unlike the English Penn Treebank, the ATB is an ongoing effort, which is being released incrementally.
    As can be expected in this situation, the annotation has changed in subtle ways between the incremental releases.
    Even within one release (especially the first) there can be inconsistencies in the annotation.
    As our approach builds on linguistic knowledge, we need to carefully study how linguistic facts are represented in the ATB.
    In this section, we briefly summarize how we obtained the data in the representation we use for our machine learning experiments.4 We use the first two releases of the ATB, ATB1 and ATB2, which are drawn from dif
