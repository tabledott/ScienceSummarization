 via some structural rules.
    Usually the semantic class of the headword is correct for the semantic class not only of the core noun phrase but also of the complete noun phrase it is part of.
    Additional rules cover exceptions, such as &amp;quot;set of ... &amp;quot;.
    These heuristics correctly predicted the semantic class of the whole noun phrase 99% of the time in the sample of over 1000 noun phrases from the WSJ that were correctly predicted by Church's PARTS program.
    Furthermore, even some of the NPs whose left boundary was not predicted correctly by PARTS nevertheless were assigned the correct semantic class.
    One consequence of this is that the correct semantic class of a complex noun phrase can be predicted even if some of the words in the noun phrase are unknown and even if its full structure is unknown.
    Thus, fully correct identification of core noun phrase boundaries and of noun phrase boundaries may not be necessary to accurately produce database updates.
