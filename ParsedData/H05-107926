othesis further we integrated the subset indicator as a feature with the values CD, IE, MT, RC, IR, PP, QA into our hybrid system.
			Indeed, the resulting overall accuracy (0.612) is significantly better thaneither shallow or deep system alone.
			Note that us ing both a combination of methodologies and thesubset indicator is necessary to improve on individ ual shallow and deep classifiers for this corpus.
			We integrated the subset indicator also into the shallowand deep classifier by themselves, yielding classi fiers Shallow+Task and Deep+Task, with no or only very small changes in accuracy (these figures are not included in Table 1).
	
	
			Our shallow analysis is similar to the IDF models proposed by (Monz and de Rijke, 2003; Saggion etal., 2004).
			We have expanded their approach by us ing other shallow features regarding text length.The basic idea of our deep analysis, using a de tailed semantic analysis and first-order inference,goes back to (Blackburn and Bos, 2005).
			It is similar to some of the
