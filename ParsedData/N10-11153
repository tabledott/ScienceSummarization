er models, e.g.
    (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007)).
    There are several attempts at incorporating arbitrary tree-based features but these involve either solving an ILP problem (Riedel and Clarke, 2006) or using computationally intensive sampling-based methods (Nakagawa, 2007).
    As a result, these models, while accurate, are slow (O(n3) for projective, first-order models, higher polynomials for higher-order models, and worse for richer tree-feature models).
    We propose a new category of dependency parsing algorithms, inspired by (Shen et al., 2007): nondirectional easy-first parsing.
    This is a greedy, deterministic parsing approach, which relaxes the leftto-right processing order of transition-based parsing algorithms.
    By doing so, we allow the explicit incorporation of rich structural features derived from both sides of the attachment point, and implicitly take into account the entire previously derived structure of the whole sentence.
    This extension allows the incorporation
