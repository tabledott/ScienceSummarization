 P(ef) P(e)P(fe).
    Here, P(fe) is the sum of P(a,fe) over all possible alignments a.
    Because this sum involves significant computation, we typically avoid it by instead searching for ane,a pair that maximizes P(e,af) P(e)P(a,fe).
    We take the language model P(e) to be a smoothed n-gram model of English.
  
  
    The stack (also called A*) decoding algorithm is a kind of best-first search which was first introduced in the domain of speech recognition (Jelinek, 1969).
    By building solutions incrementally and storing partial solutions, or hypotheses, in a &#8220;stack&#8221; (in modern terminology, a priority queue), the decoder conducts an ordered search of the solution space.
    In the ideal case (unlimited stack size and exhaustive search time), a stack decoder is guaranteed to find an optimal solution; our hope is to do almost as well under real-world constraints of limited space and time.
    The generic stack decoding algorithm follows: Initialize the stack with an empty hypothesis.
