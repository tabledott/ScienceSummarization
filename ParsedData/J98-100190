posal, researchers in the 1990s have obviously improved on earlier results, but it appears that we may nearly have reached the limit of what can be achieved in the current framework.
    For this reason, it is especially timely to assess the state of WSD and consider, in the context of its entire history, the next directions of research.
    This paper is an attempt to provide that context, at least in part, by bringing WSD into the perspective of the past 50 years of work on the topic.
    While we are aware that much more could be added to what is presented here, we have made an attempt to cover at least the major areas of work and sketch the broad lines of development in the field.&amp;quot; Of course, WSD is problematic in part because of the inherent difficulty of determining or even defining word sense, and this is not an issue that is likely to be solved in the near future.
    Nonetheless, it seems clear that current WSD research could benefit from a more comprehensive consideration of theories of mea
