 verify for himself that &amp;quot;John and John and John and John and John&amp;quot; has fourteen trees.
    Note that the power series encapsulates the ambiguity response of the system (grammar) to all possible input sentences.
    In this way, the power series is analogous to the impulse response in electrical engineering, which encapsulates the response of the system (circuit) to all possible input frequencies.
    (Ambiguity coefficients bear a strong resemblance to frequency coefficients in Fourier analysis.)
    All of these transformed representation systems (e.g., power series, impulse response, and Fourier series) provide a complete description of the system with no loss of information4 (and no heuristic approximations, for example, search strategies (Kaplan 1972)).
    Transforms are often very useful because they provide a different point of view.
    Certain observations are more easily seen in the transform space than in the original space, and vice versa.
    This paper will discuss several way
