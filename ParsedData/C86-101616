task is simple because const i tuents  are represented by atomic category labels.
  Fur thermore,  A = A, B = B, and C = C. For D PATR, the s i tuat ion is more 78 complicated.
  F i rst  of all, the const i tuents  are feature sets; second, the const i tuents  in a part ia l ly   [nstant iated rule are general ly  not equal to the corresponding const i tuents in an un ins tant ia ted  rule.
  Because of the l inks among const i tuents  in a unif icat ion-based grammar , ins tant ia t ing  B as B in the rule A -, B C may also have an effect on the feature sets of A and C. This  is why we label the resul t ing edge A{13): C. Using the feature set C to find the rules that  could instant iate  it is no more difficult than using the or iginal  C, but  it is iess efficient because the result  cannot  be saved and reused when another instance of C must  be bui l t  later.
  l.) PATR so lves  this problem by carry ing the or iginal rule along with its part ia l ly  instant iated form on active edges.
