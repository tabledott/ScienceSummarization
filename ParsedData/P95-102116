een the two lexical items, namely a relation of complementation (predicateargument relation) or of modification.
    In purely CFG-based approaches, these relations are only implicit.
    However, they represent important linguistic intuition, they provide a uniform interface to semantics, and they are, as Schabes &amp; Shieber (1994) argue, important in order to support statistical parameters in stochastic frameworks and appropriate adjunction constraints in TAG.
    In many frameworks, complementation and modification are in fact made explicit: LFG (Bresnan &amp; Kaplan, 1982) provides a separate functional (f-) structure, and dependency grammars (see e.g.
    Mel'euk (1988)) use these notions as the principal basis for syntactic representation.
    We will follow the dependency literature in referring to complementation and modification as syntactic dependency.
    As observed by Rambow and Joshi (1992), for TAG, the importance of the dependency structure means that not only the derived phrase-structure tr
