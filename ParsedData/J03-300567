    We first applied the approach to seen bigrams randomly sampled from the BNC.
    We found that the counts obtained from the Web are highly correlated with the counts obtained from the BNC.
    We then obtained bigram counts from NANTC, a corpus that is substantially larger than the BNC.
    Again, we found that Web counts are highly correlated with corpus counts.
    This indicates that Web queries can generate frequencies that are comparable to the ones obtained from a balanced, carefully edited corpus such as the BNC, but also from a large news text corpus such as NANTC.
    Secondly, we performed an evaluation that used the Web frequencies to predict human plausibility judgments for predicate-argument bigrams.
    The results show that Web counts correlate reliably with judgments, for all three types of predicate-argument bigrams tested, both seen and unseen.
    For the seen bigrams, we showed that the Web frequencies correlate better with judged plausibility than corpus frequencies.
