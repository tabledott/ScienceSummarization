act match between two subtrees, which normally does not occur very frequently.
    Collins and Duffy (2001) report that in practice, running time for the parse tree kernel is more close to linear (O(JN1J+JN2J), rather than O(JN1J*JN2J ).
    As a result, using the PC with Intel P4 3.0G CPU and 2G RAM, our system only takes about 110 minutes and 30 minutes to do training on the ACE 2003 (~77k training instances) and 2004 (~33k training instances) data, respectively.
    (2) Further Improvement: One of the potential problems in the parse tree kernel is that it carries out exact matches between sub-trees, so that this kernel fails to handle sparse phrases (i.e.
    &#8220;a car&#8221; vs. &#8220;a red car&#8221;) and near-synonymic grammar tags (for example, the variations of a verb (i.e. go, went, gone)).
    To some degree, it could possibly lead to over-fitting and compromise the performance.
    However, the above issues can be handled by allowing grammar-driven partial rule matching and other approximate ma
