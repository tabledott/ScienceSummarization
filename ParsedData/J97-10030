  TextTiling: Segmenting Text Into Multi-Paragraph Subtopic Passages
  
    Text Tiling is a technique for subdividing texts into multi-paragraph units that represent passages, or subtopics.
    The discourse cues for identifying major subtopic shifts are patterns of lexical co-occurrence and distribution.
    The algorithm is fully implemented and is shown to produce segmentation that corresponds well to human judgments of the subtopic boundaries of 12 texts.
    Multi-paragraph subtopic segmentation should be useful for many text analysis tasks, including information retrieval and summarization.
