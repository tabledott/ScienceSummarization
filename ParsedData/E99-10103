uot;) := n(C1C1')In(C'), p(wIC) = n(w)In(C).
    The function n(-) provides the frequency of a uni- or bigram in the training corpus.
    If we insert this into Eq.
    (2) and apply the negative logarithm and change the summation order we arrive at the following optimization Proceedings of EACL '99 criterion LP,.
    (Kneser and Ney, 1991): The function h(n) is a shortcut for n &#8226; log(n).
    It is necessary to fix the number of classes in C in advance as the optimum is reached if every word is a class of its own.
    Because of this it is necessary to perform an additional optimization process which determines the number of classes.
    The use of leaving-one-out in a modified optimization criterion as in (Kneser and Ney, 1993) could in principle solve this problem.
    An efficient optimization algorithm for LPI is described in section 4.
  
  
    In bilingual word clustering we are interested in classes F and E which form partitions of the vocabulary of two languages.
