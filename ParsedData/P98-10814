 taggers (tagging English text with single tags from a low detail tagset) is 9697% correctly tagged words.
    Finally, a number of rather different methods are available that generate a fully functional tagging system from annotated text.
  
  
    In 1992, van Halteren combined a number of taggers by way of a straightforward majority vote (cf. van Halteren 1996).
    Since the component taggers all used n-gram statistics to model context probabilities and the knowledge representation was hence fundamentally the same in each component, the results were limited.
    Now there are more varied systems available, a variety which we hope will lead to better combination effects.
    For this experiment we have selected four systems, primarily on the basis of availability.
    Each of these uses different features of the text to be tagged, and each has a completely different representation of the language model.
    The first and oldest system uses a traditional trigram model (Steetskamp 1995; henceforth tagger T,
