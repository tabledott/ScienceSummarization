    However, just which intonational features are important and how they communicate discourse information is not well understood.
    Prerequisite, however, to addressing these issues is the adoption of a framework of intonational description to identify which intonational features will be examined and how they will be characterized.
    For the studies discussed below, we have adopted Pierrehumbert's (1980) theory of English intonation, which we will describe briefly below.
    In Pierrehumbert's phonological description of English, intonational contours, or tunes, are described as sequences of low (L) and high (H) tones in the fundamental frequency (FO) contour, the physical correlate of pitch.
    These tunes have as their domain the intonational phrase, and are defined in terms of the pitch accent(s), phrase accent(s), and boundary tone, which together comprise an intonational phrase.
    One of the intonational fe
