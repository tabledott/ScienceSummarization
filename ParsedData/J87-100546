ompletes the proof of the six conditions, given the induction hypotheses, and thus completes the inductive proof of the theorem.
    Corollary 1 For all wffs a, gen(a) terminates with result g such that [3 has no complex terms as subexpressions.
    Proof: This follows immediately from the fifth condition in Theorem 1 and Lemma 1.

    We consider several criteria for correctness of the algorithm.
    Let U(a) = the set of variables that are unbound in a and V(a) = the set of variables that are vacuously quantified in a.6 We show that if input expression a is well-formed, that is, has no unbound variables and no vacuous quantifiers ( U(a) = V(a) = 0), and if /3 = gen(a), then Criterion 4: for every complex term t in a, there is a quantifier in [3 that binds the same variable as t and has the position held by tin a in its body; and Criterion 5: fo
