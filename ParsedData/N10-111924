features within the sentence and with the same features derived from the sentences in a window of size 1.
    For each sentence, the contextual classifier predicted either a positive, negative or neutral classification based on the label with highest probability.
    Additionally, all sentences were placed in the positive and negative sentence rankings by the probability the classifier assigned to the positive and negative classes, respectively.
    Mirroring the results of Wilson et al. (2005), we see that contextual classifiers improve results substantially over lexical matching.
    More interestingly, we see that the a contextual classifier over the web-derived lexicons maintains the performance edge over the other lexicons, though the gap is smaller.
    Figure 5 plots the precision-recall curves for the positive and negative sentence rankings, again showing that at almost every level of recall, the web-derived lexicon has higher precision.
    For a final English experiment we built a metaclassification
