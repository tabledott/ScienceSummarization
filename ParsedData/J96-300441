zi, hanzi) hanzi, hanzi, hanzii The difficulty is that given names can consist, in principle, of any hanzi or pair of hanzi, so the possible given names are limited only by the total number of hanzi, though some hanzi are certainly far more likely than others.
    For a sequence of hanzi that is a possible name, we wish to assign a probability to that sequence qua name.
    We can model this probability straightforwardly enough with a probabilistic version of the grammar just given, which would assign probabilities to the individual rules.
    For example, given a sequence F1G1G2, where F1 is a legal single-hanzi family name, and Plot of log frequency of base noun, against log frequency of plural nouns.
    G1 and G2 are hanzi, we can estimate the probability of the sequence being a name as the product of: This model is essentially the one proposed in Chang et al. (1992).
    The first probability is estimated from a name count in a text database, and the rest of the probabilities are estimated from a large l
