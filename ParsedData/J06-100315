saurus by ignoring the index and treating the thesaurus as a simple hierarchy of clusters.
  They computed semantic similarity between two words as the length of the shortest path between them.
  The words were not explicitly disambiguated.
  17 Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1 Hirst and St-Onge (1998; St-Onge 1995) adapted Morris and Hirst?s (1991) seman- tic distance algorithm from Roget?s Thesaurus to WordNet.3 They distinguished two strengths of semantic relations in WordNet.
  Two words are strongly related if one of the following holds: 1.
  They have a synset in common (for example, human and person).
  They are associated with two different synsets that are connected by the antonymy relation (for example, precursor and successor).
  One of the words is a compound (or a phrase) that includes the other and ?there is any kind of link at all between a synset associated with each word?
  (for example, school and private school).
  Two words are said to be in a medium-strong, or regular, relati
