  Dual Decomposition for Parsing with Non-Projective Head Automata
  
    This paper introduces algorithms for nonparsing based on decomposi- We focus on parsing algorithms for nonhead a generalization of head-automata models to non-projective structures.
    The dual decomposition algorithms are simple and efficient, relying on standard dynamic programming and minimum spanning tree algorithms.
    They provably solve an LP relaxation of the non-projective parsing problem.
    Empirically the LP relaxation is very often tight: for many languages, exact solutions are achieved on over 98% of test sentences.
    The accuracy of our models is higher than previous work on a broad range of datasets.
  
  
    Non-projective dependency parsing is useful for many languages that exhibit non-projective syntactic structures.
    Unfortunately, the non-projective parsing problem is known to be NP-hard for all but the simplest models (McDonald and Satta, 2007).
