    For small values of &#945; the net effect is the opposite of typical smoothing, since it tends to redistribute probably mass away from unlikely events onto more likely ones.
  
  
    ITG is slow mainly because it considers every pair of spans in two sentences as a possible chart element.
    In reality, the set of useful chart elements is much smaller than the possible scriptO(n4), where n is the average sentence length.
    Pruning the span pairs (bitext cells) that can participate in a tree (either as terminals or non-terminals) serves to not only speed up ITG parsing, but also to provide a kind of initialization hint to the training procedures, encouraging it to focus on promising regions of the alignment space.
    Given a bitext cell defined by the four boundary indices (i, j,l, m) as shown in Figure 1a, we prune based on a figure of merit V (i, j,l, m) approximating the utility of that cell in a full ITG parse.
    The figure o
