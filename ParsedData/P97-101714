 fragment shows one kind of spelling variation in Japanese: long vowel sounds (oo) are usually written with a long vowel mark (21--) but are sometimes written with repeated katakana (71-7I&amp;quot;).
    We combined corpus analysis with guidelines from a Japanese textbook (Jorden and Chaplin, 1976) to turn up many spelling variations and unusual katakana symbols: and so on.
    Spelling variation is clearest in cases where an English word like switch shows up transliterated variously (7 4 7 &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; ;4 7 &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; 4 7 1- ) in different dictionaries.
    Treating these variations as an equivalence class enables us to learn general sound mappings even if our bilingual glossary adheres to a single narrow spelling convention.
    We do not, however, 'And harmfully restrictive in their unsinoothed incarnations. generate all katakana sequences with this model; for example, we do not output strings that begin with a subscripted vowel katakana.
    So this model also serves to filter out som
