rmation provides intuitively important associations that are missing from the other.
  
  
    Our attempt to use lexical associations derived from distribution of lexical items in text shows promising results.
    Despite the errors in parsing introduced by automatically analyzing text, we are able to extract a good list of associations with prepositions, overlapping significantly with an existing dictionary.
    This information could easily be incorporated into an automatic parser, and additional sorts of lexical associations could similarly be derived from text.
    The particular approach to deciding attachment by t-score gives results nearly as good as human judges given the same information.
    Thus, we conclude that it may not be necessary to resort to a complete semantics or to discourse models to resolve many pernicious cases of attachment ambiguity.
    It is clear however, that the simple model of attachment preference that we have proposed, based only on the verb, noun and preposition, is too we
