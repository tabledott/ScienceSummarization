rosodic phrases P, and PH-1, i from 1 to n &#8212; 1.
    Each potential boundary site in our corpus is coded for features representing the three different sources of linguistic information of interest: prosody, cue phrases, and referential noun phrases.
    The linguistic features used in our two sets of experiments are shown in Figure 6.
    Our initial experiments use only the features marked as &amp;quot;o,&amp;quot; while our later experiments use the full feature set, along with modifications to the noun phrase features.
    Values for the prosodic features are obtained by automatic analysis of the transcripts, whose conventions are defined in Chafe (1980) and illustrated in Figure 5: (The values in the transcripts are based in part on an analysis of displays of fundamental frequency contours.)
    The features before and after depend on the final punctuation of the phrases P, and Pi+i, respectively.
    The value is +sentence.final.contour if &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;?&amp;quot;, -sentence.fi
