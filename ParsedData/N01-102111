st that the human parser is fundamentally serial: a function from a tree and new word to a new tree.
    These theories explain processing difficulty by appealing to &#8220;garden pathing&#8221; in which the current analysis is faced with words that cannot be reconciled with the structures built so far.
    A middle ground is held by bounded-parallelism theories (Narayanan and Jurafsky, 1998) (Roark and Johnson, 1999).
    In these theories the human parser is modeled as a function from some subset of consistent trees and the new word, to a new tree subset.
    Garden paths arise in these theories when analyses fall out of the set of trees maintained from word to word, and have to be reanalyzed, as on strictly serial theories.
    Finally, there is the possibility of total parallelism, in which the entire set of trees compatible with the input is maintained somehow from word to word.
    On such a theory, garden-pathing cannot be explained by reanalysis.
