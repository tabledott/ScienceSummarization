the proportion of times that the labels agree, and P(E) is the proportion of times that they may agree by chance.
    We define P(E) = 13 , as the labeling is based on three point scales.
    The results show that the kappa statistics for adequacy and fluency are 0.6560 and 0.6500, which indicates a substantial agreement (K: 0.610.8) according to (Landis and Koch, 1977).
    The kappa statistic for usability is 0.5849, which is only moderate (K: 0.41-0.6).
    Table 2 shows an example of the generated paraphrases.
    A source sentence s is paraphrased in each application and we can see that: (1) for sentence compression, the paraphrase t is 8 bytes shorter than s; (2) for sentence simplification, the words wealth and part in t are easier than their sources asset and proportion, especially for the non-native speakers; (3) for sentence similarity computation, the reference sentence s' is listed below t, in which the words appearing in t but not in s are highlighted in blue.
    In our experiments, we implement
