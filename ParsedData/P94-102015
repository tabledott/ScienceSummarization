ic spelling form occurring in the same sentence as the ambiguous word.
    All of our collocational variables are dichotomous, indicating the presence or absence of the associated spelling form.
    While collocation-specific variables are, by definition, specific to the word being disambiguated, the procedure used to select them is general.
    The search for collocationspecific variables was limited to the 400 most frequent spelling forms in a data sample composed of sentences containing interest.
    Out of these 400, the five spelling forms found to be the most informative using the test described above were selected as the collocational variables.
    It is not enough to know that each of the features described above is highly correlated with the meaning of the ambiguous word.
    In order to use the features in concert to perform disambiguation, a model describing the interactions among them is needed.
    Since we had no reason to prefer, a priori, one form of model over another, all models describing
