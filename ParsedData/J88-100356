ducts from the error count those particular instances in which the Corpus tag indicates by an affix that the word is part of a headline, title, etc.
    Since the syntax of such structures is often deviant, such errors are less significant.
    The difference this makes ranges from 0.09% (Genre L), up to 0.64% (Genre A), with an unweighted mean of 0.31%.
    Detailed breakdowns of the particular errors made for each genre exist in machine-readable form.
  
  
    The high degree of lexical category ambiguity in languages such as English poses problems for parsing.
    Specifically, until the categories of individual words have been established, it is difficult to construct a unique and accurate syntactic structure.
    Therefore, a method for locally disambiguating lexical items has been developed.
    Early efforts to solve this problem relied upon large libraries of manually chosen context frame rules.
    More recently, however, work on the LOB Corpus of British English led to a more systematic algorithm b
