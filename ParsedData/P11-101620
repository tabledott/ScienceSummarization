    We also manually classify each tweet as positive, negative or neutral about the corresponding query.
    Then, we analyze those tweets that get different labels from TS and humans.
    Finally we find two major types of error: 1) Tweets which are totally neutral (for any target) are classified as subjective by TS; 2) sentiments in some tweets are classified correctly but the sentiments are not truly about the query.
    The two types take up about 35% and 40% of the total errors, respectively.
    The second type is actually what we want to resolve in this paper.
    After further checking those tweets of the second type, we found that most of them are actually neutral for the target, which means that the dominant error in Twitter Sentiment is classifying neutral tweets as subjective.
    Below are several examples of the second type where the bolded words are the targets.
