unication), it can be reduced to a sorting problem.
    The inequality set (C) is used to filter out irrelevant data, that is pairs of words supposedly not used consistently within a single syntactic structure.
    This section discusses the importance of each inequality in (C) on the filtering process. strength = freq &#8212; f &gt; ko (CO Condition (C1) helps eliminate the collocates that are not frequent enough.
    This condition specifies that the frequency of appearance of w, in the neighborhood of w must be at least one standard deviation above the average.
    In most statistical distributions, this thresholding eliminates the vast majority of the lexical relations.
    For example, for w = &amp;quot;takeover,&amp;quot; among the 3385 possible collocates only 167 were selected, which gives a proportion of 95% rejected.
    In the case of the standard normal distribution, this would reject some 68% of the cases.
    This indicates that the actual distribution of the collocates of &amp;quot;takeover&amp
