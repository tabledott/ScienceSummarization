e LCS of the concepts, and then scales that by the sum of the depths of the individual concepts.
    The depth of a concept is simply its distance to the root node.
    The measure path is a baseline that is equal to the inverse of the shortest path between two concepts.
    WordNet::Similarity supports two hypothetical root nodes that can be turned on and off.
    When on, one root node subsumes all of the noun concepts, and another subsumes all of the verb concepts.
    This allows for similarity measures to be applied to any pair of nouns or verbs.
    If the hypothetical root nodes are off, then concepts must be in the same physical hierarchy for a measurement to be taken.
  
  
    Measures of relatedness are more general in that they can be made across part of speech boundaries, and they are not limited to considering is-a relations.
    There are three such measures in the package: hso (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998), lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003), and vector (Patwardhan, 2003).
    The hso measures cla
