evious section showed how to compute several of the most commonly used values for parsers, including Boolean, inside, Viterbi, counting, and derivation forest values, among others.
    Noticeably absent from the list are the outside probabilities, which we define below.
    In general, computing outside probabilities is significantly more complicated than computing inside probabilities.
    In this section, we show how to compute outside probabilities from the same item-based descriptions used for computing inside values.
    Outside probabilities have many uses, including for reestimating grammar probabilities (Baker 1979), for improving parser performance on some criteria (Goodman 1996b), for speeding parsing in some formalisms, such as data-oriented parsing (Goodman 1996a), and for good thresholding algorithms (Goodman 1997).
    We will show that by substituting other semirings, we can get values analogous to the outside probabilities for any commutative semiring; elsewhere (Goodman 1998) we have shown th
