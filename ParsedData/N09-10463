 be tuned using very small amounts of manually created reference lattices.
    Furthermore, since these parameters were chosen to have valid interpretation across a variety of languages, we find that the weights estimated for one apply quite well to another.
    We show that these lattices significantly improve translation quality when translating into English from three languages exhibiting productive compounding: German, Turkish, and Hungarian.
    The paper is structured as follows.
    In the next section, we describe translation from segmentation lattices and give a motivating example, Section 3 describes our segmentation model and its tuning and how it is used to generate segmentation lattices, Section 5 presents experimental results, Section 6 reviews relevant related work, and in Section 7 we conclude and discuss future work.
  
  
    In this section we give a brief overview of lattice translation and then describe the characteristics of segmentation lattices that are appropriate for translation.
