    The concept of left extraposition plays an essential role, directly or indirectly, in many formal descriptions of relative and interrogative clauses.
    Related to this concept, there are several &amp;quot;global constraints&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;island constraints&amp;quot;, that have been introduced to restrict the situations in which left extraposition can be applied.
    For instance, the Ross complex-NP constraint [8], implies that any relative pronoun occurring outside a given noun phrase cannot be bound to a trace occurring inside a relative clause which is a subconstituent of the noun phrase.
    This means that it is not possible to have a configuration like Xi... [np [rel X2 [s t2 tl 1] ...
    Note that here I use the concept of left extraposition in a loose sense, without relating it to transformations as in transformational grammar.
    In XGs, and also in other formalisms for describing languages (for instance the context-free rule schemas of Gazdar [5]), the notion o
