7738; {(r, w&#57742;)  |&#57739;(w, r, w&#57742;)} For convenience, we further extend the notation for weighted attribute vectors.
    A subscripted asterisk indicates that the variables are bound together: For weight functions we use similar notation: Table 1 defines the measure functions evaluated in these experiments.
    The simplest measure functions (prefix SET) use the attribute set model from IR and are taken from Manning and Sch&#168;utze (1999), pp.
    299.
    When these are used with weighted attributes, if the weight is greater than zero, then it is considered in the set.
    Other measures, such as LIN and JACCARD have previously been used for thesaurus extraction (Lin, 1998a; Grefenstette, 1994).
    Finally, we have generalised some set measures using similar reasoning to Grefenstette (1994).
    Alternative generalisations are marked with a dagger.
    These experiments also cover a range of weight functions as defined in Table 2.
    The weight functions LIN98A, LIN98B, and GREF94 are taken
