sion we call the restriction and the assertions in a part called the body.
    (Henceforth, we will uniformly use the terms restriction and body.)
    The separation of these two semantic roles of range and scope into restriction and body as an important fact of the logical structure of English can be seen, for example, in Woods's four-part quantifier structures (Woods 1977), in the recommendations of Moore (1981), and in the generalized quantifier research of Barwise and Cooper and others.
    The latter have demonstrated the necessity of such a separation for quantifiers other than the standard first-order ones (Barwise and Cooper, 1981; Cushing, 1976).
    But under this understanding of English logical structure, it follows that no sixth reading exists for sentence (1) above.
    Consider the reading in which the universal outscopes the most which outscopes the existential in the logical form for this sentence.
    Then, using the notation of Moore (1981) for four-part quantifier structures, the logical f
