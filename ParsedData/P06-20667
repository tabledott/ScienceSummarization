estriction to projective analyses has a number of advantages, there is clear evidence that it cannot be maintained for real-world data (Zeman, 2004; Nivre, 2006).
    For example, the graph in Figure 1 is non-projective: the yield of the node 1 (marked by the dashed rectangles) does not form an interval&#8212;the node 2 is &#8216;missing&#8217;.
    In this section, we present several proposals for structural constraints that relax projectivity, and relate them to each other.
    The notion of planarity appears in work on Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1993), where it is traced back to Mel&#8217;&#711;cuk (1988).
    Informally, a dependency graph is planar, if its edges can be drawn above the sentence without crossing.
    We emphasize the word above, because planarity as it is understood here does not coincide with the standard graph-theoretic concept of the same name, where one would be allowed to also use the area below the sentence to disentangle the edges.
    Figure 2a shows a dependency graph th
