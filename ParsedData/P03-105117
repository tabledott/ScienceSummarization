an input sentence is obtained according to the formula (10), where ti is the part-of-speech of morpheme mi, and N is the number of morphemes in the input sentence.
    (10) SEGMENTATIONbest = Argmax &#928;i=1,N p(mi|mi-1 mi-2) p(ti|ti-1 ti-2) p(mi|ti) By using the joint model, the segmentation word error rate of the best performing segmenter has been reduced by about 10% from 2.9% (cf. the last column of Table 5) to 2.6%.
  
  
    We have presented a robust word segmentation algorithm which segments a word into a prefix*-stem-suffix* sequence, along with experimental results.
    Our Arabic word segmentation system implementing the algorithm achieves around 97% segmentation accuracy on a development test corpus containing 28,449 word tokens.
    Since the algorithm can identify any number of prefixes and suffixes of a given token, it is generally applicable to various language families including agglutinative languages (Korean, Turkish, Finnish), highly inflected languages (Russian, Czech) as well as semitic
