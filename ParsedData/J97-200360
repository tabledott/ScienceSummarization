ducer has also the minimal number of transitions among all subsequential transducers realizing the same function.
    This generalizes the analogous theorem that holds in the case of automata.
    The proof is similar.
    Let T be a subsequential transducer with a minimal number of transitions.
    Clearly, pushing does not change the number of transitions of T and automatan minimization, which consists of merging equivalent states, reduces or does not change this number.
    Thus, the number of transitions of the minimal transducer equivalent to T as previously defined is less or equal to that of T. This proves the corollary since, as previously pointed out, equivalent minimal transducers all have the same topology: in particular, they have the same number of states and transitions.
    Given two subsequential transducers, one might wish to test their equivalence.
    The importance of this problem was pointed out by Hoperoft and Ullman (1979, 284).
    The following corollary addresses this question.
