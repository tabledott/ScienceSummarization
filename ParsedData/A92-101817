set of N states, a matrix c transition probabilities A -= la,11 1 &lt; i, j &lt; N where a, is the probability of moving from state i to state j, and vector of initial probabilities H = {70 1 &lt; i &lt; N where 71 is the probability of starting in state i.
    The symbol ger erator is a state-dependent measure on V described by matrix of symbol probabilities B {kik} 1 &lt; j &lt; N an 1 &lt; k &lt; M where M = IW I and kik is the probability ( generating symbol sk given that the Markov process is i state j.2 In part-of-speech tagging, we will model word order di pendency through an underlying Markov process that 01 erates in terms of lexical tags,' yet we will only be ab to observe the sets of tags, or ambiguity classes, that ai possible for individual words.
    The ambiguity class of eac word is the set of its permitted parts of speech, only or of which is correct in context.
    Given the parameters .4, and II, hidden Markov modeling allows us to compute ti most probable sequence of state transitions, and
