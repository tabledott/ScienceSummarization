    The semrel structure for a definition of car is given in the figure below. car: &amp;quot;a vehicle with 3 or usu.
    4 wheels and driven by a motor, esp. one one for carrying people&amp;quot; Early dictionary-based work focused on the extraction of paradigmatic relations, in particular Hypernym relations (e.g., car&#8212;Hypernym-4vehicle).
    Almost exclusively, these relations, as well as other syntagmatic ones, have continued to take the form of relational triples (see Wilks et al. 1996).
    The larger contexts from which these relations have been taken have generally not been retained.
    For labeled relations, only a few researchers (recently, Barriere and Popowich 1996), have appeared to be interested in entire semantic structures extracted from dictionary definitions, though they have not reported extracting a significant number of them.
  
  
    After semrel structures are created, they are fully inverted and propagated throughout the entire MindNet database, being
