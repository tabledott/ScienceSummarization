ir belonging to that relation.
    Once all of the entity pairs discovered during testing have been classified, they can be ranked by confidence score and used to generate a list of the n most likely new relation instances.
    Table 4 shows some high-weight features learned by our system.
    We discuss the results in the next section.
  
  
    We evaluate labels in two ways: automatically, by holding out part of the Freebase relation data during training, and comparing newly discovered relation instances against this held-out data, and manually, having humans who look at each positively labeled entity pair and mark whether the relation indeed holds between the participants.
    Both evaluations allow us to calculate the precision of the system for the best N instances.
    Figure 2 shows the performance of our classifier on held-out Freebase relation data.
    While held-out evaluation suffers from false negatives, it gives a rough measure of precision without requiring expensive human evaluation, making i
