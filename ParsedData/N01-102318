s between words in a sentence.
    However, there was no statistical model for attachments and the notion of mutual constraints between these two steps was not exploited in this work.
    Previous studies in unsupervised methods for parsing have concentrated on the use of inside-outside algorithm (Lari and Young, 1990; Carroll and Rooth, 1998).
    However, there are several limitations of the inside-outside algorithm for unsupervised parsing, see (Marcken, 1995) for some experiments that draw out the mismatch between minimizing error rate and iteratively increasing the likelihood of the corpus.
    Other approaches have tried to move away from phrase structural representations into dependency style parsing (Lafferty et al., 1992; Fong and Wu, 1996).
    However, there are still inherent computational limitations due to the vast search space (see (Pietra et al., 1994) for discussion).
    None of these approaches can even be realistically compared to supervised parsers that are trained and tested on the kind
