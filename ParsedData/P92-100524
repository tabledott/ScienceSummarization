 a derivation also means that a monotonic treatment of ellipsis resolution does not need to resort to higher-order unification.
    Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira use higher-order unification to 'unpick' the composition of constituent meanings obtained in the semantic derivation from the ellipsis antecedent.
    Some of these meanings are then put back together to produce a predicate that can be applied to the ellipsis arguments.
    Since monotonic resolution does not carry out the final composition of meanings, but merely sets out conditions on how it is to take place, there is no need to unpick composed meanings and put them back together again.
    It is worth pointing out that monotonic interpretation is compatible with approaches to meaning as a transition between contexts or information states, and where the order in which transitions are made is significant (e.g.
    Veltman 1991).
    In such a framework, monotonic interpretation would amount to making decisions about which transitions to take when,
