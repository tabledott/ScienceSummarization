    Each set of MT translations contains 929 English sentences, each of which is associated with human judgments for its fluency and adequacy.
    The fluency and adequacy scores both range from 1 to 5.
    Our syntactic metrics are motivated by a desire to better capture grammaticality in MT evaluation, and thus we are most interested in how well they correlate with human judgments of sentences&#8217; fluency, rather than the adequacy of the translation.
    To do this, the syntactic metrics (computed with the Collins (1999) parser) as well as BLEU were used to evaluate hypotheses in the test set from ACL05 MT workshop, which provides both fluency and adequacy scores for each sentence, and their Pearson coefficients of correlation with the human fluency scores were computed.
    For BLEU and HWCM, in order to avoid assigning zero scores to individual sentences, when precision for n-grams of a particular length is zero we replace it with an epsilon value of 10&#8722;3.
    We choose E14 and E15 as two rep
