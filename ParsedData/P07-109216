n of the lexical probability feature yielded a substantial gain of up to two BLEU points over a basic feature set.
  
  
    The evaluation of our method was motivated by three questions: (1) How do different training requirements affect the performance of the triangulated models presented in this paper?
    We expect performance gains with triangulation on small and moderate datasets.
    (2) Is machine translation output influenced by the choice of the intermediate language/s?
    Here, we would like to evaluate whether the number and choice of intermediate languages matters.
    (3) What is the quality of the triangulated phrase-table?
    In particular, we are interested in the resulting distribution and whether it is sufficiently distinct from the standard phrase-table.
    Before reporting our results, we briefly discuss the specific choice of model for our experiments.
    As mentioned in Section 3, our method combines the with 0-1 indicator features, and separate phrase-tables, respectively. triangula
