    Converting a phrase structure treebank with only a few functions to a dependency format usually requires linguistic competence in the treebank&#8217;s language in order to create the head table and missing function labels.
    We are grateful to Chanev et al. (2006) for converting the BulTreeBank to the shared task format and to Montserrat Civit for providing us with a head table and a function mapping for Cast3LB.28 Table 1 shows details of all data sets.
    Following Nivre and Nilsson (2005) we use the following definition: &#8220;an arc (i, j) is projective iff all nodes occurring between i and j are dominated by i (where dominates is the transitive closure of the arc rela26Many thanks to Montserrat Civit and Toni Martifor allowing us to use Cast3L
