oot symbol.
    We also define |X  |to be the rank of the rule, i.e., the number of variables in it.
    For example, rules r1 and r3 in Section 1 are both of rank 2.
    If a rule has no variable, i.e., it is of rank zero, then it is called a purely lexical rule, which performs a phrasal translation as in phrase-based models.
    Rule r2, for instance, can be thought of as a phrase pair (the gunman, qiangshou).
    Informally speaking, a derivation in a transducer is a sequence of steps converting a source-language tree into a target-language string, with each step applying one tranduction rule.
    However, it can also be formalized as a tree, following the notion of derivation-tree in TAG (Joshi and Schabes, 1997): Definition 2.
    A derivation d, its source and target projections, noted &#163;(d) and C(d) respectively, are recursively defined as follows: derivation with the root symbol of its source projection matches the corresponding substitution node in r, i.e., &#961;(&#163;(di)) = &#966;(xi), then d
