at all.
    No conflated feature reached significance, but it is not the case that all conflated features are worse than their same-constituent &#8220;double-feature&#8221; counterparts.
    We found no simple correlation between finer-grained feature scores (and/or boundary condition type) and combination or conflation scores.
    Since some combinations seem to cancel individual contributions, we can conclude that the higher the number of participant features (of the kinds described here), the more likely a cancellation effect is; therefore, a &#8220;double-feature&#8221; combination is more likely to yield higher gains than a combination containing more features.
    We also investigated whether non-canonical linguistic constituency labels such as PRN, FRAG, UCP and VSB introduce &#8220;noise&#8221;, by means of the XP features &#8212; the XP= feature is, in fact, simply the undifferentiated constituency feature, but sensitive only to &#8220;standard&#8221; XPs.
