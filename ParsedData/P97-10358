ho acquires the information, although this information is not used for evaluation.
    During the dialogue the agent must acquire from the user the values of DC, AC, and DR, while the user must acquire DT.
    Performance evaluation for an agent requires a corpus of dialogues between users and the agent, in which users execute a set of scenarios.
    Each scenario execution has a corresponding AVM instantiation indicating the task information requirements for the scenario, where each attribute is paired with the attribute value obtained via the dialogue.
    For example, assume that a scenario requires the user to find a train from Torino to Milano that leaves in the evening, as in the longer versions of Dialogues 1 and 2 in Figures 2 and 3.4 Table 2 contains an AVM corresponding to a &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; for this scenario.
    All dialogues resulting from execution of this scenario in which the agent and the user correctly convey all attribute values (as in Figures 2 and 3) would have the same AVM as the
