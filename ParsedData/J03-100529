rsed with respect to their roles in German-to-English translation.
    For the example translation in Figure 7, the order in which the source sentence positions are covered is given in Figure 8.
    We generalize the two approaches for the different translation directions as follows: In both approaches, we assume that the source sentence is mainly processed monotonically.
    A small number of upcoming source sentence positions may be processed earlier than they would be in the monotonic traversal: The states Skip and Move are used as explained in the preceding section.
    The positions to be processed outside the monotonic traversal are restricted as follows: Word reordering for the translation direction English to German: The reordering is restricted to the English verb group.
    These restrictions will be fully formalized later in this section.
    In the state Move, some source sentence positions are &#8220;moved&#8221; from later in the sentence to earlier.
    After source sentence positions are moved
