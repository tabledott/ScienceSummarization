d.
    Thus the surprising fact is that these PCFG parsers ever produce a nonzero number of NP attachments and VP attachments in the same tree sequence.
    This is possible because the node label V in the attachment schema above abbreviates several different preterminal labels (i.e., the set of all verbal tags).
    Further investigation shows that once the V label in NP attachment and VP attachment schemas is instantiated with a particular verbal tag, only either the relevant NP attachment schema or the VP attachment schema appears in the tree sequence.
    For instance, in the Id tree sequence (i.e., produced by the standard tree bank grammar) the 67 NP attachments all occurred with the V label instantiated to the verbal tag AUX.'
    It is worth noting that the 8% improvement in average precision and recall obtained by the parent annotation transform is approximately half of the performance difference between a parser using a PCFG induced directly from the tree bank (i.e., using the Id transform above) an
