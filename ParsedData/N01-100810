 of COCKTAIL we have trained the system on 30 MUC-6 and MUC-7 texts and tested it on the remaining 30 documents.
    We computed the precision, the recall and the Fmeasure.
    The performance measures have been obtained automatically using the MUC-6 coreference scoring program (Vilain et al. 1995).
    Table 4 lists the results.
    Table 4 shows that the seed set of rules had good precision but poor recall.
    By combining the rules with the entropy-based measure, we obtained further enhancement in precision, but the recall dropped.
    The application of the bootstrapping methodology determined an enhancement of recall, and thus of the F-measure.
    In the future we intend to compare the overall effect of rules that recognize referential expressions on the overall performance of the system.
  
  
    We have introduced a new data-driven method for coreference resolution, implemented in the COCKTAIL system.
    Unlike other knowledge-poor methods for coreference resolution (Baldwin 1997) (Mitkov 1998), CO
