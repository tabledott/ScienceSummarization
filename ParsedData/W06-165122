follows.
			1) We define six coefficients cx and c?x, where x ? {O,S,L} to modify a group of weights as follows.
			?i, x, wxi := wxi ? cx; ?i, x, w?xi := w?xi ? c?x; In general, increasing cx will promote recall, while increasing c?x will promote precision.Also, setting co &gt; cs will put higher confi dence on the opinion extraction classifier than the source extraction classifier.
			2) We also define one constant cA to set the weights for auxiliary variable Ai.
			That is, ?i, wAi := cA.
			3) Finally, we adjust the confidence of the linkvariable based on n-th-best sequences of the en tity extraction classifiers as follows.
			?i, wLi,j := wLi,j ? d where d def= 4/(3 + min(m,n)), when Oi is from an m-th sequence and Sj is from a n-th sequence.11 11This will smoothly degrade the confidence of a link based on the entities from higher n-th sequences.
			Values of d decrease as 4/4, 4/5, 4/6, 4/7....
	
	
			We evaluate our system using the NRRC Multi Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) corpusthat contains 5
