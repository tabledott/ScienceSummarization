 (1997) showed that restricting word-level alignments between sentence pairs to observe syntactic bracketing constraints significantly reduces the complexity of the alignment problem and allows a polynomial-time solution.
    Alshawi et al. (2000) also induce parallel tree structures from unbracketed parallel text, modeling the generation of each node&#8217;s children with a finite-state transducer.
    Yamada and Knight (2001) present an algorithm for estimating probabilistic parameters for a similar model which represents translation as a sequence of re-ordering operations over children of nodes in a syntactic tree, using automatic parser output for the initial tree structures.
    The use of explicit syntactic information for the target language in this model has led to excellent translation results (Yamada and Knight, 2002), and raises the prospect of training a statistical system using syntactic information for both sides of the parallel corpus.
