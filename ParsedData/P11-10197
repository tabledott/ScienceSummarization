 asking learners to write either a letter, a report, an article, a composition or a short story, between 200 and 400 words.
    Answers to each of these tasks are annotated with marks (in the range 1&#8211;40), which have been fitted to a RASCH model (Fischer and Molenaar, 1995) to correct for inter-examiner inconsistency and comparability.
    In addition, an overall mark is assigned to both tasks, which is the one we use in our experiments.
    Each script has been also manually tagged with information about the linguistic errors committed, using a taxonomy of approximately 80 error types (Nicholls, 2003).
    The following is an example errorcoded sentence: In the morning, you are &lt;NS type = &#8220;TV&#8221;&gt; waken|woken&lt;/NS&gt; up by a singing puppy.
    In this sentence, TV denotes an incorrect tense of verb error, where waken can be corrected to woken.
    Our data consists of 1141 scripts from the year 2000 for training written by 1141 distinct learners, and 97 scripts from the year 2001 for t
