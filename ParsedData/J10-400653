tational advantages in cases like ours, in which we measure the association of three elements, because it does not require keeping track of the full 2 x 2 x 2 contingency table, which is the case for the log-likelihood ratio.
    Following standard practice (Bullinaria and Levy 2007), negative weights (cases where the observed value is lower than the expected value) are raised to 0.
    The number of non-zero tuples in the DepDM tensor is about 110M, including tuples with direct links and their inverses.
    DepDM is a 30,693 x 796 x 30,693 tensor with density 0.0149% (the proportion of non-zero entries in the tensor).
    LexDM.
    The second model is inspired by the idea that the lexical material connecting two words is very informative about their relation (Hearst 1992; Pantel and Pennacchiotti 2006; Turney 2006b).
    LLexDM contains complex links, each with the structure pattern+suffix.
    The suffix is in turn formed by two substrings separated by a +, each respectively encoding the following features
