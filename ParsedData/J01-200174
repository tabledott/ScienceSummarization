ean languages, we include signatures found from a 500,000-word corpus of English (Table 4), a 350,000-word corpus of French (Table 5), Don Quijote, which contains 124,716 words of Spanish (Table 6), a 125,000-word corpus of Latin (Table 7), and 100,000 words and 1,000,000 words of Italian (Tables 8 and 9).
    The 500,000-word (token-count) corpus of English (the first part of the Brown Corpus) contains slightly more than 30,000 distinct words.
    To illustrate the difference of scale that is observed depending on the size of the corpus, compare the signatures obtained in Italian on a corpus of 100,000 words (Table 8) and a corpus of 1,000,000 words (Table 9).
