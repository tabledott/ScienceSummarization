 We represent the segmentation data for each narrative as an i x j matrix of height i=7 subjects and width j=n-1.
    The value in each cell co is a one if the ith subject assigned a boundary at site j, and a zero if they did not.
    We use Cochran's test (Cochran, 1950) to evaluate significance of differences across columns in the matrix.'
    Cochran's test assumes that the number of is within a single row of the matrix is fixed by observation, and that the totals across rows can vary.
    Here a row total corresponds to the total number 'We thank Julia Hirschberg for suggesting this test. ablePercent Agreement with the Majority Opinion of boundaries assigned by subject i.
    In the case of narrative 9 (j=96), one of the subjects assigned 8 boundaries.
    The probability of a 1 in any of the j cells of the row is thus 8/96, with (986) ways for the 8 boundaries to be distributed.
    Taking this into account for each row, Cochran's test evaluates the null hypothesis that the number of is in a column, here
