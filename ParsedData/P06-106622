we get the worst performance, even worse than the monotone search.
    This indicates that our language models were not strong to discriminate between straight orders and inverted orders.
    The flat and distortion reordering models (Row 3 and 4) show similar performance with Pharaoh.
    Although they are not dependent on phrases, they really reorder phrases with penalties to wrong orders supported by the language model and therefore outperform the monotone search.
    In row 6, only lexical features are used for the MaxEnt-based reordering model; while row 7 uses lexical features and collocation features.
    On both tasks, we observe that various reordering approaches show similar and stable performance ranks in different domains and the MaxEnt-based reordering models achieve the best performance among them.
    Using all features for the MaxEnt model (lex + col) is marginally better than using only lex features (lex).
    In the experiments described above, collocation features do not make great contribu
