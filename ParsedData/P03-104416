 after this point, the learner begins to acquire patterns describing secondary events, derivative of or commonly co-occurring with the focal topic.
    Examples of such events are fluctuations in stock prices, revenue estimates, and other common business news elements.
    The Baseline 54% is the precision we would expect to get by randomly marking the documents as relevant to the scenario.
    The performance of the Management Succession learner counter-trained against other learners is traced by the curve labeled Counter.
    It is important to recall that the counter-trained algorithm terminates at the final point on the curve, whereas the mono-trained case it does not.
    We checked the quality of the discovered patterns by hand.
    Termination occurs at 142 iterations.
    We observed that after iteration 103 only 10% of the patterns are &#8220;good&#8221;, the rest are secondary.
    However, in the first 103 iterations, over 90% of the patterns are good Management Succession patterns.
