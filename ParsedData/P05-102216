g to the n-best parser model.
    The other features are integer valued; informally, each feature is associated with a particular configuration, and the feature&#8217;s value fj(y) is the number of times that the configuration that fj indicates.
    For example, the feature feat pizza(y) counts the number of times that a phrase in y headed by eat has a complement phrase headed by pizza.
    Features belong to feature schema, which are abstract schema from which specific features are instantiated.
    For example, the feature feat pizza is an instance of the &#8220;Heads&#8221; schema.
    Feature schema are often parameterized in various ways.
    For example, the &#8220;Heads&#8221; schema is parameterized by the type of heads that the feature schema identifies.
    Following Grimshaw (1997), we associate each phrase with a lexical head and a function head.
    For example, the lexical head of an NP is a noun while the functional head of an NP is a determiner, and the lexical head of a VP is a main verb whil
