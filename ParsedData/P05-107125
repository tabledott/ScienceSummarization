ted corpora exist, and for which very few written corpora of any kind exist (making the dialects bad candidates even for unsupervised learning).
    However, there is a fair amount of descriptive work on dialectal morphology, so that dialectal morphological analyzers may be easier to come by than dialect corpora.
    We intend to explore to what extent we can transfer models trained on Standard Arabic to dialectal morphological disambiguation.
