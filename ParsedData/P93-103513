 final punctuation always attached high.
    Since there was less regular structure in this case than in the right-linear case, many more transformations were found, 147 transformations in total.
    When these transformations were applied to the test set, a bracketing accuracy of 87.13% resulted.
    The ATIS corpus is structurally fairly regular.
    To determine how well our algorithm performs on a more complex corpus, we ran experiments on the Wall Street Journal.
    Results from this experiment can be found in table 2.9 Accuracy is again In table 4, we show the standard deviation measured from three different randomly chosen training sets of each sample size and randomly chosen test sets of 500 sentences each, as well as 2-20, 63% accuracy is achieved and for sentences of length 2-25, accuracy is 59%.
    &amp;quot;In all of our experiments carried out on the Wall Street Journal, the test set was a randomly selected set of 500 sentences.
    &amp;quot;For sentences of length 2-15, the initial right line
