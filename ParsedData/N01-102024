question as to whether we can augment these methods with translation probabilities estimated from statistical frequency information gleaned from loosely aligned or unaligned bilingual corpora for non-cognate pairs.
    Various machine learning techniques, including co-training and mutual bootstrapping, could employ these additional measures in creating better estimates.
    The techniques presented here are useful for language pairs where an on-line translation lexicon does not already exist, including the large majority of the world's lower-density languages.
    For language pairs with existing translation lexicons, these methods can help improve coverage, especially for technical vocabulary and other more recent borrowings which are often cognate but frequently missing from existing dictionaries.
    In both cases, the great potential of this work is the ability to leverage a single bilingual dictionary into translation lexicons for its entire language family, without any additional resources beyond raw wo
