l sentences from very-non-parallel corpora.
    The baseline experiment shows that without iteration, the performance is at 42.8%.
    We carried out another set of experiment of using Bootstrapping where the bilingual lexicon is not updated in each iteration.
    The bilingual sentence extraction accuracy of the top 2500 sentence pairs in this case dropped to 65.2%, with only 1% relative degradation.
    Based on the above, we conclude that EM lexical learning has little effect on the overall parallel sentence extraction output.
    This is probably due to the fact that whereas EM does find new word translations (such as A&#35834;&#20999;&#29305;/Pinochet), this has little effect on the overall glossing of the Chinese document since such new words are rare.
  
  
    Previous work on extracting bilingual or monolingual sentence pairs from comparable corpora has only been applied to documents that are within the same topic, or have very similar publication dates.
    One principle for previous methods is &#82
