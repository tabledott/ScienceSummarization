lynomial time, we conclude that D is NP-complete.2 SAT: Given vectors of boolean variables v = (v) and propositional clauses3 C = (C), decide whether there exists an assignment to v that simultaneously satisfies each clause in C. For a SAT instance (v, C), we construct f to contain one word for each clause, and e to contain several copies of the literals that appear in those clauses. &#966; scores only alignments from clauses to literals that satisfy the clauses.
    The crux of the construction lies in ensuring that no variable is assigned both true and false.
    The details of constructing such a weighted sentence pair wsp(v, C) = (e, f, &#966;), described below, are also depicted in figure 1.
    Then, we set &#966;(&#183;, &#183;) = 0 everywhere except: Proof.
    The score implies that f aligns using all oneword phrases and Vai E a, 0(ai) = 1.
    By condition 4, each fassign(v) aligns to all v&#65533; or all v in e. Then, assign each v to true if fassign(v) aligns to all v, and false otherwise.
