This characterization is in line with so called X-theory, according to which a sentence belongs to the category V. In general, a phrase of category X, for whatever X, has a head constituent of category X, that is, a category with the same name but one less bar.
    X is built into the very fabric of the version of FUG illutrated here where, for example, a setence is by definition a phrase whose head's head is a verb.

    The first would usually be called its subject but is here characterized as the subject
