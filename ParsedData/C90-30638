 for the use of selectional constraints in resolving anaphoric references.
  Such cases were non- anaphoric occurrences of "it", cases where the ref- erent was not a noun phrase and cases where the anaphor was not involved in one of the three rela- tions that we used.
  In addition, we have excluded cases where there was only one possible referent, so that our results will reflect correctly the perfor~ mance of the disambiguation method.
  The filtering process eliminated about two t.hirds of the original sentences, and we proceeded with 59 examples.
  The alternative candidates for the referent (which satisfy definite syntactic constrair, ts such as number, gen- der and requirements for reflexives) were identified manually in each example.
  1 The statistics were collected from part o[ the cor- pus, of about 28 million words.
  For 21 out of the 59 examples the statistics were not meaningful (we used a threshold of 5 occurrences for each of the alterna- tive patterns).
  In these cases the algorithm cannot a
