fic model to discover goodweights.
			The second method for combining the in formation is to use the weights from the separately trained simple models and then combine them in a LOP.
			Held out data is used to set the multiplicative constant needed to balance the contribution of the two models.
			We can see that this second approach is more successful and this suggests that it is importantto carefully consider the best ways of combining dif ferent sources of information when using ensembles of models.
			However, the results of this experiment are not very conclusive.
			There is no uncertainty inthe source sentence and the value of modelling it us ing CCG supertags is still to be demonstrated.
	
	
			The factored translation model allows for the inclusion of valuable sources of information in many dif ferent ways.
			We have shown that the syntacticallyrich CCG supertags do improve the translation pro cess and we investigate the best way of including them in the factored model.
