descan then be further classified into the set of argument la bels.
			For example, in the tree of Figure 1, the node IN that encompasses ?for?
			is a NULL node because it does not correspond to a semantic argument.
			The node NP that encompasses ?about 20 minutes?
			is a NON-NULL node, since it does correspond to a semantic argument ? ARGM-TMP.
	
	
			Our baseline system uses the same set of features in troduced by G&amp;J. Some of the features, viz., predicate, voice and verb sub-categorization are shared by all thenodes in the tree.
			All the others change with the con stituent under consideration.
			Predicate ? The predicate itself is used as a feature.
			Path ? The syntactic path through the parse tree from the parse constituent to the predicate being classified.
			For example, in Figure 1, the path from ARG0 ? ?He?
			to the predicate talked, is represented with the string NP?S?VP?VBD.
			and ? representupward and downward movement in the tree respec tively.
			Phrase Type ? This is the syntactic
