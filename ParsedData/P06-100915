iagonal.
    We also included two conjunction features for the relative sentence position multiplied by the Dice and Model 1 translation scores.
    Null We use a number of variants on the above features for alignments between a source word and the null target.
    The maximum translation score between the source and one of the target words engineering and for fitting a Gaussian prior.
    The word aligned data are annotated with both sure (S) and possible (P) alignments (S C P; Och and Ney (2003)), where the possible alignments indicate ambiguous or idiomatic alignments.
    We measure the performance of our model using alignment error rate (AER), which is defined as: where A is the set of predicted alignments.
    The second data set is the Romanian-English parallel corpus from the 2005 ACL shared task (Martin et al., 2005).
    This consists of approximately 50,000 aligned sentences and 448 wordaligned sentences, which are split into a 248 sentence trial set and a 200 sentence test set.
