er, the main difference between our approach and Tomita's is the way in which the CF grammar that drives the parser comes into being.
    Even though a unification grammar will be, at best, equivalent to a very large (and at worst, if features are employed in recursive or cyclic ways, possibly infinite) set of atomic-category CF productions, in practice we have obtained LR parsers that perform well from backbone grammars containing only about 30% more productions than the original unification grammar.
    The construction method ensures that for any given grammar the CF backbone captures at least as much information as the optimal CFG that contains the same number of rules as the unification grammar.
    Thus the construction method guarantees that the resulting LR parser will terminate and will be as predictive as the source grammar in principle allows.
    Building the backbone grammar is a two-stage process: Backbone grammar corresponding to object grammar.

    For each unification grammar rule, cre
