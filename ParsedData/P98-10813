stacked, or combined classifiers.
    It has been shown that, when the errors are uncorrelated to a sufficient degree, the resulting combined classifier will often perform better than all the individual systems (Ali and Pazzani 1996; Chan and Stolfo 1995; Turner and Gosh 1996).
    The underlying assumption is twofold.
    First, the combined votes will make the system more robust to the quirks of each learner's particular bias.
    Also, the use of information about each individual method's behaviour in principle even admits the possibility to fix collective errors.
    We will execute our investigation by means of an experiment.
    The NLP task used in the experiment is morpho-syntactic wordclass tagging.
    The reasons for this choice are several.
    First of all, tagging is a widely researched and well-understood task (cf. van Halteren (ed.)
    1998).
    Second, current performance levels on this task still leave room for improvement: 'state of the art' performance for data driven automatic wordclass
