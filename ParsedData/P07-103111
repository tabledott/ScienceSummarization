.
    The number of dependencies is fixed by the length of the NP, so the dependency precision and recall are the same.
    Counting matched brackets is a harsher evaluation, as there are many NPs that both annotators agree should have no additional bracketing, which are not taken into account by the metric.
    The disagreements occurred for a small number of repeated instances, such as this case: The first annotator felt that Goldman , Sachs should form their own NML constituent, while the second annotator did not.
    We can also look at exact matching on NPs, where the annotators originally agreed in 2667 of 2908 cases (91.71%), and after revision, in 2864 of 2907 cases (98.52%).
    These results demonstrate that high agreement rates are achievable for these annotations.
    Another approach to measuring annotator reliability is to compare with an independently annotated corpus on the same text.
    We used the PARC700 Dependency Bank (King et al., 2003) which consists of 700 Section 23 sentences annotat
