 are tested in the given order until one test succeeds.
    Just after an anaphoric expression is resolved, the S-list is updated.
    The algorithm processes a text from left to right (the unit of processing is the word): 2.
    If the analysis of utterance U5 is finished, remove all discourse entities from the S-list, which are not realized in U.
    The analysis for example (1) is given in Table 36.
    I show only these steps which are of interest for the computation of the S-list and the pronoun resolution.
    The preferences for pronouns (in bold font) are given by the S-list immediately above them.
    The pronoun &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; in (lb) is resolved to the first element of the S-list.
