quot; poorly correlates with &amp;quot;car.&amp;quot; Yet, it is true that &amp;quot;-es&amp;quot; is a valid suffix for the words &amp;quot;flashes,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;catches,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;kisses,&amp;quot; and many other words where the &amp;quot;-es&amp;quot; is preceded by a voiceless sibilant.
    Hence, there is merit to considering subrules that arise while performing analysis on a particular rule.
    For instance, while evaluating the (&amp;quot;es&amp;quot;, NULL) rule, it is desirable to also consider potential subrules such as (&amp;quot;ches&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ch&amp;quot;) and (&amp;quot;tes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;t&amp;quot;).
    One might expect that the average NCS for the (&amp;quot;ches&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ch&amp;quot;) subrule might be higher than the overall rule (&amp;quot;es&amp;quot;, NULL) whereas the opposite will likely be true for (&amp;quot;tes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;t&amp;quot;).
    Table 2 confirms this.
