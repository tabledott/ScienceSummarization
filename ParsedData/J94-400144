ead-dependent relations are good enough to analyze each phrase/clause of the CSs internally and the sentence in which CSs are merged into nodes, respectively.
    Second, as shown in the upper part of Table 5, we classified the 150 sentences by their length and according to whether they contain CSs or not.
    We manually checked whether CSs in each sentence were detected correctly, if they exit, and whether their dependency structures were analyzed correctly.
    The table shows that CSs are generally well recognized, but the total success ratio of getting proper dependency structures is 65% (97/150).
    To determine how well a conventional method (described in the introduction) works on such long sentences, we parsed the same test sentences by another method simulating a conventional one.
    This method uses a simple rule, instead of our dynamic programming method, that a KB depends on the most similar CB (calculated by the process in Section 3.1).
    It parses a sentence, determining the head bunsetsu f
