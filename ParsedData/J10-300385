 the sentence pairs were judged to be paraphrases of each other and the rest were judged to be non-equivalent.14 Although the MSRP Corpus is a valuable resource and its creation provided valuable insight into what constitutes a paraphrase in the practical sense, it does have some shortcomings.
    For example, one of the heuristics used in the extraction process was that the two sentences in a pair must share at least three words.
    Using this constraint rules out any paraphrase pairs that are fully lexically divergent but still semantically equivalent.
    The small size of the corpus, when combined with this and other such constraints, precludes the use of the corpus as training data for a paraphrase generation or extraction system.
    However, it is fairly useful as a freely available test set to evaluate paraphrase recognition methods.
    On a related note, Fujita and Inui (2005) take a more knowledge-intensive approach to building a Japanese corpus containing sentence pairs with binary paraphrase jud
