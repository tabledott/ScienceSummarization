    We saw that these features, discriminatively trained using MIRA, led to significant improvements, and took a closer look at the results to see how the new features qualitatively improved translation quality.
    We draw three conclusions from this study.
    First, we have shown that these new features can improve the performance even of top-scoring MT systems.
    Second, these results add to a growing body of evidence that MIRA is preferable to MERT for discriminative training.
    When training over 10,000 features on a modest amount of data, we, like Watanabe et al. (2007), did observe overfitting, yet saw improvements on new data.
    Third, we have shown that syntax-based machine translation offers possibilities for features not available in other models, making syntax-based MT and MIRA an especially strong combination for future work.
