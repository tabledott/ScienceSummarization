ult: Levy and Manning (2003) adapt the unlexicalized parser of Klein and Manning (2003) to Chinese, but even after significant efforts on choosing category splits, only modest performance gains are reported.
    In contrast, automatically learned grammars like the one of Matsuzaki et al. (2005) and Petrov et al.
    (2006) require a treebank for training but no additional human input.
    One has therefore reason to believe that their performance will generalize better across languages than the performance of parsers that have been hand tailored to English.
    We trained models for English, Chinese and German using the standard corpora and splits as shown in Tab.
    3.
    We applied our model directly to each of the treebanks, without any language dependent modifications.
    Specifically, the same model hyperparameters (merging percentage and smoothing factor) were used in all experiments.
    Tab.
    4 shows that automatically inducing latent structure is a technique that generalizes well across languag
