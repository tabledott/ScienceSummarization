    All three are written in a variant of the unification formalism used in the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992) .
    The basic building block of the grammar formalism is a category with feature constraints.
    Here is an example: up: [wh=ynq , case= (nomVacc ) , pers _num= ( 3rdAsg ) This category can be instantiated by any noun phrase with the value ynq for its wh feature (which means it must be a wh-bearing noun phrase like which book, who, or whose mother), either acc (accusative) or nom (nominative) for its case feature, and the conjunctive value 3rdAsg (third and singular) for its person-number feature.
    This formalism is related directly to the Core Language Engine, but more conceptually it is closely related to that of other unification-based grammar formalisms with a context-free skeleton, such as PATR-II (Shieber et al., 1983), Categorial Unification Grammar (Uszkoreit, 1986), Generalized Phrase-Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al., 1982), Gemini differs from other unification formali
