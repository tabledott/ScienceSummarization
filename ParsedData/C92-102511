se at hand, the two plu- rals in sociaux-ddmocrates are realized in the regular way, as shown in Figure 6. sociau 0 x -d~mocrate  0 s Figure 6 By first intersecting the rules in each set and then composing the results in the way shown in Figure 2, we end up with a transducer that eliminates the intermedi- ate level altogether and maps the lexical representation directly to the correct sur- face form, and vice versa.
  Figure 7 illus- trates the final result.

  AUG. 23-28, 1992 The representation in Figure 7 fulfills the desiderata l id out in Section 2 except that it contains a special diacritic +DPL that marks the behavior of social-ddmocrate, with respect o plural formation.
  In the next section, we show how that diacritic can be eliminated.
