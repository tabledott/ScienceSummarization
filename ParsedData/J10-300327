 the right&#8212;for each candidate paraphrase C and storing the (anchor, candidate) tuple in H. These anchors are taken to constitute the distribution of the words and phrases under inspection.
    Finally, each occurrence of a pair of potential paraphrases, that is, a pair sharing one or more anchors, is counted.
    The final set of phrasal paraphrastic pairs is returned.
    This algorithm embodies the spirit of the hypothesis of distributional similarity: It considers all words and phrases that are distributionally similar&#8212;those that occur with the same sets of anchors (or distributions)&#8212;to be paraphrases of each other.
    Additionally, the larger the set of shared anchors for two candidate phrases, the stronger the likelihood that they are paraphrases of each other.
    After extracting the list of paraphrases, less likely phrasal paraphrases are filtered out by using an appropriate count threshold.
    Pas&#184;ca and Dienes (2005) attempt to make their anchors even more informative by att
