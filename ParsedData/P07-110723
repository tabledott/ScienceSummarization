nominals analogously to the treatment of proper and nominal mentions.
    We also tested our system on the Chinese newswire and broadcast news sections of the ACE 2004 training sets.
    Our relatively higher performance on Chinese compared to English is perhaps due to the lack of prenominal mentions in the Chinese data, as well as the presence of fewer pronouns compared to English.
    Our ACE results are difficult to compare exactly to previous work because we did not have access to the restricted formal test set.
    However, we can perform a rough comparison between our results on the training data (without coreference annotation) to supervised work which has used the same training data (with coreference annotation) and evaluated on the formal test set.
    Denis and Baldridge (2007) report 67.1 F1 and 69.2 F1 on the English NWIRE and BNEWS respectively using true mention boundaries.
    While our system underperforms the supervised systems, its accuracy is nonetheless promising.
