class model are considered in this study, one with two latent categories, one with three latent categories, and one with four.
    We apply these models to three data configurations: one with two categories (subjective and objective with no certainty ratings), one with four categories (subjective and objective with coarse-grained certainty ratings, as shown in Table 1), and one with eight categories (subjective and objective with fine-grained certainty ratings).
    All combinations of model and data configuration are evaluated, except the four-category latent class model with the twocategory data configuration, due to insufficient degrees of freedom.
    In all cases, the models fit the data well, as measured by G2.
    The model chosen as final is the one for which the agreement among the latent categories assigned to the three data configurations is highest, that is, the model that is most consistent across the three data configurations.
