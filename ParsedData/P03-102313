nd also damage the accuracy of the antecedent selection: too many comparisons are made between incorrect candidates.
    Therefore, in order to reduce the computational cost and data noises, an effective candidate filtering strategy must be applied in our approach.
    During training, we create the candidate set for each anaphor with the following filtering algorithm: Features describing the two candidates During resolution, we filter the candidates for each encountered pronoun in the same way as during training.
    That is, we only consider the NPs in the current and the preceding 2 sentences.
    Such a context window is reasonable as the distance between a pronominal anaphor and its antecedent is generally short.
    In the MUC-6 data set, for example, the immediate antecedents of 95% pronominal anaphors can be found within the above distance.
    Comparatively, candidate filtering for nonpronouns during resolution is complicated.
    A potential problem is that for each non-pronoun under consideration,
