rences.
    For example, Kintsch and Mross (1985) show that priming words that enter frequent collocations with test words (i.e., iron-steel, which they call associative context) activate these test words in lexical decision tasks.
    Conversely, priming words that are in the thematic context (i.e., relations determined by the situation, scenario, or script such as plane-gate) do not facilitate the subjects' lexical decisions (see also Fischler [1977], Seidenberg et al. [1982], De Groot [1983], Lupker [19841).
    Yarowsky (1993) explicitly addresses the use of collocations in WSD work, but admittedly adapts the definition to his purpose as &amp;quot;the co-occurrence of two words in some defined relation.&amp;quot; As noted above, he examines a variety of distance relations, but also considers adjacency by part of speech (e.g., first noun to the left).
    He determines that in cases of binary ambiguity, there exists one sense per collocation, that is, in a given collocation, a word is used with only one se
