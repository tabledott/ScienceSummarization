e that inserting the additional adjunction nodes inserted by the NP-VP and N'-V' transformations above have the effect of converting a local dependency (which can be described by a PCFG) into a nonlocal dependency (which cannot).
    Another initially surprising property of the tree sequences produced by the PCFGs is that they do not reflect at all well the frequency of the different kinds of PP attachment found in the Penn II corpus.
    This is in fact to be expected, since the sequences consist of maximum-likelihood parses.
    To see this, consider any of the examples analyzed in Section 4.
    In all of these cases, the corpora contained two tree structures, and the induced PCFG associates each with an estimated likelihood.
    If these likelihoods differ, then a maximum-likelihood parser will always return the same maximum-likelihood tree structure each time it is presented with its yield, and will never return the tree structure with lower likelihood, even though the PCFG assigns it a nonzero likelihoo
