le, called &#8220;Stargazers,&#8221; whose main topic is the existence of life on earth and other planets.
    Its contents can be described as consisting of the following subtopic discussions (numbers indicate paragraphs): The TextTiling algorithm (Hearst 1993, 1994, 1997) attempts to recognize these subtopic changes by making use of patterns of lexical co-occurrence and distribution; subtopic boundaries are assumed to occur at the point in the documents at which large shifts in vocabulary occur.
    Many others have used this technique, or slight variations of it, for subtopic segmentation (Nomoto and Nitta 1994; Hasnah 1996; Richmond, Smith, and Amitay 1997; Heinonen 1998; Boguraev and Neff 2000).
    Other techniques use clustering and/or similarity matrices based on word co-occurrences (Reynar 1994; Yaari 1997; Choi 2000), and still others use machine learning techniques to detect cue words, or hand-selected cue words to detect segment boundaries (Passonneau and Litman 1993; Beeferman, Berger, and Laffer
