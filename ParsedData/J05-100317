n (or maximum-entropy) models and boosting.
    These methods form the basis for the reranking approaches described in later sections of the article.
    Maximum-entropy models are a very popular method within the computational linguistics community; see, for example, Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra (1996) for an early article which introduces the models and motivates them.
    Boosting approaches to classification have received considerable attention in the machine-learning community since the introduction of AdaBoost by Freund and Schapire (1997).
    Boosting algorithms, and in particular the relationship between boosting algorithms and maximum-entropy models, are perhaps not familiar topics in the NLP literature.
    However there has recently been much work drawing connections between the two methods (Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani 2000; Lafferty 1999; Duffy and Helmbold 1999; Mason, Bartlett, and Baxter 1999; Lebanon and Lafferty 2001; Collins, Schapire, and Singer 2002); in this section we rev
