is model, the experiments in Klein and Manning (2004) and only used sentences of 10 words or fewer, without punctuation, and with gold-standard tags.
    Punctuation in particular seems to trip up the initializer: since a sentence-final periods appear in most sentences, EM often decides to make it the head. plateaus.
    Still, this method substantially improves over the baselines and unsupervised EM.
    Restricting ourselves to fully projected trees seems a waste of information.
    We can also simply take all one-to-one projected links, impute expected counts for the remaining dependencies with EM, and update our models.
    This approach (&#8220;hard projection with EM&#8221;), however, performed worse than using only the fully projected trees.
    In fact, only the first iteration of EM with this method made any improvement; afterwards, EM degraded accuracy further from the numbers in Table 3.
    The quasi-synchronous model used all of the alignments in re-estimating its parameters and performed signifi
