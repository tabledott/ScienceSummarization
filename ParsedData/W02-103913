t by far most of the crossings do not reflect lack of phrasal cohesion between the two languages.
    Instead, they are caused either by errors in the syntactic analysis or the fact that translation as done by humans is a much richer process than just replication of the source sentence in another language.
    Sentences are reworded, clauses are reordered, and sometimes human translators even make mistakes.
    Errors in syntactic analysis consist mostly of attachment errors.
    Rewording and reordering accounted for a large number of crossings as well.
    In most of the cases of rewording (see Figure 4) or relorsque nous avons pr&#180;epar&#180;e le budget , nous avons pris cela en consid&#180;eration ordering (see Figure 5) a more &#8220;parallel&#8221; translation would also be valid.
    Thus, while it would be difficult for a statistical model to learn from these examples, there is nothing to preclude production of a valid translation from a system using phrasal movement in the reordering phase.
