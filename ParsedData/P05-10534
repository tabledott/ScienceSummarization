    The relation extraction task was formulated at the 7th Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7 1998) and is starting to be addressed more and more within the natural language processing and machine learning communities.
    Miller et al (2000) augmented syntactic full parse trees with semantic information corresponding to entities and relations, and built generative models for the augmented trees.
    Zelenko et al (2003) proposed extracting relations by computing kernel functions between parse trees.
    Culotta et al (2004) extended this work to estimate kernel functions between augmented dependency trees and achieved 63.2 F-measure in relation detection and 45.8 F-measure in relation detection and classification on the 5 ACE relation types.
    Kambhatla (2004) employed Maximum Entropy models for relation extraction with features derived from word, entity type, mention level, overlap, dependency tree and parse tree.
    It achieves 52.8 Fmeasure on the 24 ACE relation subtypes.
