ute some partially lexicalized modifying nonterminal.
    The (unlexicalized) nonterminal-mapping functions alpha and gamma are defined in Section 6.1.
    As a shorthand, y(M(t)i) = y(Mi),tMi.
    The head-generation parameter class, PH, gap-generation parameter class, PG, and subcat-generation parameter classes, PsubcatL and PsubcatR, have back-off structures as follows: The two parameter classes for generating modifying nonterminals that are not dominated by a base NP, PM and PMw, have the following back-off structures.
    Recall that back-off level 2 of the PMw parameters includes words that are the heads of the observed roots of sentences (that is, the headword of the entire sentence).
    The two parameter classes for generating modifying nonterminals that are children of base NPs (NPB nodes), PM,NPB and PMw,NPB, have the following back-off structures.
    Back-off level 2 of the PMw,NPB parameters includes words that are the heads of the observed roots of sentences (that is, the headword of the entire
