t that a source word is aligned with two or more target words.
    Therefore, lexical correspondences like 'Zahnarzttermin' for dentist's appointment cause problems because a single source word must be mapped on two or more target words.
    To solve this problem for the alignment in training, we first reverse the translation direction, i. e. English is now the source language, and German is the target language.
    For this reversed translation direction, we perform the usual training and then check the alignment paths obtained in the maximum approximation.
    Whenever a German word is aligned with a sequence of the adjacent English words, this sequence is added to the English vocabulary as an additional entry.
    As a result, we have an extended English vocabulary.
    Using this new vocabulary, we then perform the stan2.3 Extension to Handle Non-Monotonicity Our approach assumes that the alignment is monotone with respect to the word order for the lion's share of all word alignments.
