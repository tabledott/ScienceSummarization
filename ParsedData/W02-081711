 finding the sense that minimizes the violation of constraints in the instance being tagged.
    COBALT generates confidences in its tagging of a given instance based on how much the constraints were satisfied and violated for that instance.
    Both taggers use WordNet 1.7 dictionary glosses and relations.
    The performance of the two systems and their level of agreement were evaluated on the Senseval noun data set.
    The two systems agreed in their classification decision in 54.96% of the cases.
    This low agreement level is a good indication that the two approaches are fairly orthogonal, and therefore we may hope for high disambiguation precision on the agreement set.
    Indeed, the tagging accuracy measured on the set where both COBALT and STAFS assign the same label is 82.5%, a figure that is close to the 85.5% inter-annotator agreement measured for the SENSEVAL-2 nouns (Kilgarriff, 2002).
    Table 1 lists the precision for the agreement and disagreement sets of the two taggers.
