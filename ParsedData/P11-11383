nt to refer to the statistical technique rather than the location.
    Global approaches utilize the Wikipedia link graph to estimate coherence.
    Document teat with mentions In this paper, we analyze global and local approaches to the D2W task.
    Our contributions are as follows: (1) We present a formulation of the D2W task as an optimization problem with local and global variants, and identify the strengths and the weaknesses of each, (2) Using this formulation, we present a new global D2W system, called GLOW.
    In experiments on existing and novel D2W data sets,1 GLOW is shown to outperform the previous stateof-the-art system of (Milne and Witten, 2008b), (3) We present an error analysis and identify the key remaining challenge: determining when mentions refer to concepts not captured in Wikipedia.
  
  
    We formalize our Disambiguation to Wikipedia (D2W) task as follows.
    We are given a document d with a set of mentions M = {m1,... , mN}, and our goal is to produce a mapping from the set of me
