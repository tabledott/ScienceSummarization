 and a source of inefficiency in the Earley generator, is eliminated.
    Indeed, the example here was completely deterministic; all rule choices were forced.
    Finally, even though much of the processing is top-down, left-recursive rules (e.g., rule (3)) are still handled in a constrained manner by the algorithm.
    For these reasons, we feel that the semantichead-driven algorithm is a significant improvement over top-down methods and the previous bottom-up method based on Earley deduction.
  
  
    We will now outline how the algorithm and the grammar it uses can be extended to encompass some important analyses and constraints.
    Wedekind (1988) defines completeness and coherence of a generation algorithm as follows.
    Suppose a generator derives a string w from a logical form s, and the grammar assigns to w the logical form a.
    The generator is complete ifs always subsumes a and coherent if a always subsumes s. The generator defined in Section 4.1 is not coherent or complete in this sense; it re
