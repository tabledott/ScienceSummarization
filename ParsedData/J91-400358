ncept of being confined.
    From this concept, we can apply the negation operator, generating the predicate opposition of not-confined and confined.
    To this, we apply the two temporal operators, &lt; and &gt;, generating two states: free before capture and free after capture.
    Finally, to these concepts, if we apply the operator act, varying who is responsible for the resulting transition event, we generate the concepts: turn in, capture, escape, and release.
    Projecting on Telic Role of prisoner: These relations constitute the projective conclusion space for the telic role of prisoner relative to the application of the transformations mentioned above.
    Similar operations on the formal role will generate concepts such as die and kill.
    Generating such structures for all items in a sentence during analysis, we can take those graphs that result in no contradictions to be the legitimate semantic interpretations of the entire sentence.
    Let us now return to the sentences in Example 58.
