hey are less categorical in nature, more closely tied to morphological features, and more directly geared towards the basic task of pars- ing.
  We see this task as one of inferring surface structure from a stream of concrete tokens in a basically bottom-up mode.
  Constraints are formu- lated on the basis of extensive corpus studies.
  They may reflect absolute, ruleqike facts, or probabilistic tendencies where a certain risk is judged to be proper to take.
  Constraints of the former rule-like type are of course preferable.
  The ensemble of constraints for language L con- stitute a Constraint Grammar (CG) for L. A CG is intended to be used by the Constraint Grammar Parser CGP, implemented as a Lisp interpreter.
  Our input tokens to CGP are morphologically ana- lyzed word-forms.
  One central idea is to maximize the use of morphological information for parsing purposes.
  All relevant structure is assigned directly via lexicon, morphology, and simple mappings from morphology to syntax.
