 reviewers jointly examined cases where was disagreement, discussed reasons, reconciled the differences.
    5.2 Experimental Validation of the In order to independently validate our definiof similarity, we performed additional experiments.
    In the first, we asked three addijudges to determine a ransample 40 paragraph pairs.
    High agreement between judges would indicate that our definition of similarity reflects an objective reality and can be mapped unambiguously to an operational procedure for marking text units as similar or not.
    At the same time, it would also validate the judgments between text units that we use for our experiments (see Section 5.1). this task, judges were given opportuprovide reasons for claiming similarity or dissimilarity, and comments on the task were for future analysis. three additional 207 judges agreed with the manually marked and standardized corpus on 97.6% of the comparisons.
    Unfortunately, approximately 97% (depending on the specific experiment) of the compariso
