r extension to the [G3W86] theory &#8212; a property-sharing constraint which attempts to enforce a parallellism between entities in successive utterances.
    She considers two properties: SUB/ and IDENT .
    With her extension, subject pronouns prefer subject antecedents and non-subject pronouns prefer non-subject antecedents.
    However, structural parallelism is a consequence of our ordering the Cf list by grammatical function and the preference for continuing over retaining.
    Furthermore, the constraints suggested in [GJW86] succeed in many cases without invoking an independent structural parallelism constraint, due to the distinction between continuing and retaining, which Kameyama fails to consider.
    Her example which we reproduce in figure 5 can also be accounted for using the continuing/retaining distinctions.
    The third utterance in this example has two interpretations which are both consistent with the centering rules and constraints.
    Because of rule 2, the interpretation in figure 5
