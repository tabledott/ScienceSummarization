 versus verb, rather than the fine distinction which the CLAWS tag-set adds, such as several subtypes of proper noun.
    Ongoing research with VOLSUNGA may shed more light on the interaction of these factors.
    Last, the current version of VOLSUNGA is designed for use with a complete dictionary (as is the case when working with a known corpus).
    Thus, unknown words are handled in a rudimentary fashion.
    This problem has been repeatedly solved via affix analysis, as mentioned above, and is not of substantial interest here.
    Since the number of paths over a span is an exponential function of the span length, it may not be obvious how one can guarantee finding the best path, without examining an exponential number of paths (namely all of them).
    The insight making fast discovery of the optimal path possible is the use of a Dynamic Programming solution (Dano (1975), Dreyfus and Law (1977)).
    The two key ideas of Dynamic Programming have been characterized as &amp;quot;first, the recognition that
