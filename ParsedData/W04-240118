roperties of a unimodular matrix.
    As a result, most of the vertices of the polyhedron are integer points.
    Another possible reason is that given the cost function we have, the optimal solution is always integer.
    Because of the availability of very efficient LP/ILP packages, we defer the exploration of this direction for now.
  
  
    We describe below two experiments on the problem of simultaneously recognizing entities and relations.
    In the first, we view the task as a knowledge acquisition task &#8211; we let the system read sentences and identify entities and relations among them.
    Given that this is a difficult task which may require quite often information beyond the sentence, we consider also a &#8220;forced decision&#8221; task, in which we simulate a question answering situation &#8211; we ask the system, say, &#8220;who killed whom&#8221; and evaluate it on identifying correctly the relation and its arguments, given that it is known that somewhere in this sentence this relation is
