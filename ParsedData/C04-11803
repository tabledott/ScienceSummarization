n in hand.There is some existing work with a similar motivation to ours.
			Briscoe and Carroll (2002) gen erate underspecified semantic representations fromtheir robust parser.
			Toutanova et al (2002) and Ka plan et al (2004) combine statistical methods with a linguistically motivated grammar formalism (HPSG and LFG respectively) in an attempt to achieve levels of robustness and accuracy comparable to the Penn Treebank parsers (which Kaplan et al do achieve).
			However, there is a key difference between these approaches and ours.
			In our approach the creation of the semantic representations forms a completely It could cost taxpayers 15 million to install and residents 1 million a year to maintain NP
