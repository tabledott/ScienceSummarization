in syntactic structures.
    Since we interpret the principles with descriptions of the structures, instead of the structures themselves, we must be able to model these notions with the descriptions.
    Dominance and m-command: Dominance and m-command are relationships between nodes in syntactic structures.
    Since an item represent a node in a syntactic structure, relationships between the nodes can be represented by relationships between items: dominance: An item dominates its direct and indirect sources.
    For example, in Figure 2, i4 dominates i1, i2, and i3. in-command: The head daughter of an item representing a maximal category m-commands nonhead daughters of the item and their sources.
    Barrier Chomsky (1986) proposed the notion of barrier to unify the treatment of government and subjacency.
    In Chomsky's proposal, barrierhood is a property of maximal nodes (nodes representing maximal categories).
    However, not every maximal node is a barrier.
    The barrierhood of a node also depends o
