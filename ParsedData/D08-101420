2% to 3.5%.
    Since the Spanish automatic translation seems to be closer to a human-quality translation, we are not surprised that this time the first experiment is able to generate a more accurate training corpus as compared to the second experiment.
    The MPQA corpus, since it is manually annotated and of better quality, has a higher chance of generating a more reliable data set in the target language.
    As in the experiments on Romanian, when performing automatic translation of the test data, we obtain the best results with an F-measure of 73.41%, which is also the upper bound on our proposed experiments.
  
  
    Based on our experiments, we can conclude that machine translation offers a viable approach to generating resources for subjectivity annotation in a given target language.
    The results suggest that either a manually annotated dataset or an automatically annotated one can provide sufficient leverage towards building a tool for subjectivity analysis.
    Since the use of parallel corpora
