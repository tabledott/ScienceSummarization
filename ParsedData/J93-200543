    Indeed, the only verb occurring in this position with any frequency is the copula be, namely with the following counts: 12 be/V venture/O.
    Thus, weak semantic types can be induced on the basis of syntactic behavior.
    There is a growing literature on corpus-based acquisition and tuning (Smadja 1991a; Zernik and Jacobs 1991; Brent 1991; as well as Grishman and Sterling 1992).
    We share with these researchers a general dependence on well-behaved collocational patterns and distributional structures.
    Probably the main distinguishing feature of our approach is its reliance on a fairly well studied semantic framework to aid and guide the semantic induction process itself, whether it involves selectional restrictions or semantic types.
  
  
    In the previous section we presented algorithms for extracting collocational information from corpora, in order to supplement and fine-tune the lexical structures seeded by a machine-readable dictionary.
    In this section we demonstrate that, in addition t
