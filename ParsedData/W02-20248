classifiers (stacking), feature selection and system combination.
    Each of these techniques were shown to be useful (Spanish test set: F,3=1=75.78; Dutch test set: F,3=1=70.67).
    Burger, Henderson and Morgan (2002) have evaluated three approaches to finding named entities.
    They started with a baseline system which consisted of an HMM-based phrase tagger.
    They gave the tagger access to a list of approximately 250,000 named entities and the performance improved.
    After this several smoothed word classes derived from the available data were incorporated into the training process.
    The system performed better with the derived word lists than with the external named entity lists (Spanish test set: F,3=1=75.78; Dutch test set: F,3=1=72.57).
    Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002) approached the shared task by using word-internal and contextual information stored in character-based tries.
    Their system obtained good results by using part-of-speech tag information and employing the one sense per disco
