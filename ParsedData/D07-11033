 Our Approach to Statistical Machine.
			TranslationWe define a phrasetable as a set of source phrases (n grams) s?
			and their translations (m-grams) t?, along with associated translation probabilities p(s?|t?) and p(t?|s?).
			These conditional distributions are derivedfrom the joint frequencies c(s?, t?)
			of source / tar get n,m-grams observed in a word-aligned parallel corpus.
			These joint counts are estimated using the phrase induction algorithm described in (Koehn etal., 2003), with symmetrized word alignments gen erated using IBM model 2 (Brown et al, 1993).
			Phrases are limited to 8 tokens in length (n,m ? 8).
			Given a source sentence s, our phrase-based SMT system tries to find the target sentence t?
			that is the most likely translation of s. To make search more efficient, we use the Viterbi approximation and seek the most likely combination of t and its alignment a with s, rather than just the most likely t: t?
			= argmax t p(t|s) ? argmax t,a p(t,a|s),where a = (s?1, t?1, j1), ..., (s?K
