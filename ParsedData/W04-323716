ut-off values for the feature selection procedure on the adaptation data.
    As can be seen, very few features are added to the background model.
    Table 5 presents the variation in log-likelihood and capitalization accuracy on the CNN adaptation training and development data, respectively.
    The adaptation procedure was found cut-off threshold used for feature selection on CNNtrn adaptation data; the entry corresponding to the cut-off threshold of 106 represents the number of features in the background model to be insensitive to the number of reestimation iterations, and, more surprisingly, to the number of features added to the background model from the adaptation data, as shown in 5.
    The most sensitive parameter is the prior variance &#963;2, as shown in Figure 1; its value is chosen to maximize classification accuracy on development data.
    As expected, low values of &#963;2 result in no adaptation at all, whereas high values of &#963;2 fit the training data very well, and result in a dramatic
