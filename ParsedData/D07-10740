  It describes in detail the disam- biguation paradigm employed and the information extraction process from Wikipedia.
  Through a process of maximizing the agreement between the contextual information extracted from Wikipedia and the context of a document, as well as the agreement among the category tags associated with the candidate entities, the implemented sys- tem shows high disambiguation accuracy on both news stories
