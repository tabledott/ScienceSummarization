example, one of the words significantly associated with &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;.
    Many dictionaries, for example Merriam-Webster's Ninth, make no explicit mention of &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; in the entry for &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;, although British learners' dictionaries do make specific mention of &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; in connection with &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;.
    These learners' dictionaries pay more attention to language structure and collocation than do American collegiate dictionaries, and lexicographers trained in the British tradition are often fairly skilled at spotting these generalizations.
    However, teasing out such facts, and distinguishing true intuitions from false intuitions takes a lot of time and hard work, and there is a high probability of inconsistencies and omissions.
