require complex reasoning (we grouped these in what we call the &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot; class).
    We nevertheless developed heuristic techniques for processing these types of definites as well, the idea being that these heuristics may provide a baseline against which the gains in performance due to the use of commonsense knowledge can be assessed more clearly.2 The paper is organized as follows: We first summarize the results of our previous corpus study (Poesio and Vieira 1998) (Section 2) and then discuss the model of definite description processing that we adopted as a result of that work and the general architecture of the system (Section 3).
    In Section 4 we discuss the heuristics that we developed for resolving anaphoric definite descriptions, recognizing discourse-new descriptions, and processing bridging descriptions, and, in Section 5, how the performance of these heuristics was evaluated using the annotated corpus.
    Finally, we present the final configuration of the two versions of the
