t which they are created; hence all features can be defined in terms of the individual entries which make up the derivations.
    Calculating E&#923; fi requires summing over all derivations &#969; which include fi for each sentence S in the training data.
    The key to performing this sum efficiently is to write the sum in terms of inside and outside scores for each conjunctive node.
    The inside and outside scores can be defined recursively.
    If the inside score for a conjunctive node c is denoted &#966;c, and the outside score denoted &#968;c, then the expected value of fi can be written as follows: where CS is the set of conjunctive nodes in the packed chart for sentence S. The inside score for a conjunctive node, &#966;c, is defined in terms of the inside scores of c&#8217;s disjunctive node daughters: where &#955; &#183; f (c) = ~i &#955;ifi(c).
    If the conjunctive node is a leaf node, the inside score is just the exponentiation of the sum of the feature weights on that node.
    The outside sc
