  *riptioml Adjoining can now be defined as follows.
  If # is adjoined to at the node n then the resulting tree "Tt is as shown in Fig.
  7 = ~: $ X /   / /  / node / X  / n I I   - - -X - - - t 3" = S /   3 / ~~vithout IX   t - - /   - - / - -x - - / / +- - FiKure 2.1 The tree t dominnted by X in 3 is excised, ~ is inserted at the node n in "7 and the tree t is attached to the foot node (lab*lled X) of ~, i.e., ~ is inserted or adjoined to the node n in 3 pushing t downwards, Note that ~ljoinmg is not a suJmtitutioa operation.
  We will now define T(G): The set of alJ trees derived in G starting from initial trees in I.
  This set will be called the tree set of G. L(G): The set of all terminal s t r inp which
