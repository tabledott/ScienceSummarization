    The organization of attributive adjectives is based on the antonymy relation.
    Where direct antonyms exist, adjective synsets point to antonym synsets.
    A head adjective is one that has a direct antonym (e.g., hot versus cold or long versus short).
    Many adjectives, like sultry, have no direct antonyms.
    When an adjective has no direct antonym, its synset points to a head that is semantically similar to it.
    Thus sultry and torrid are similar in meaning to hot, which has the direct antonym of cold.
    So, although sultry has no direct antonym, it has cold as its indirect antonym.
    Relational adjectives do not have antonyms; instead they point to nouns.
    Consider the difference between a nervous disorder and a nervous student.
    In the former, nervous pertains to a noun, as in nervous system, whereas the latter is defined by its relation to other adjectives&#8212;its synonyms (e.g., edgy) and antonyms (e.g., relaxed).
    Adverbs have synonymy and antonymy relatio
