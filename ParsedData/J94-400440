ferent levels.
  In particular, the * serves as a pointer to a RLCS position that must be combined with another RLCS in order to arrive at a (portion of a) CLCS.
  The lexical entries for enter and entrar illustrate the difference in the use of this parameter: 612 Bonnie J. Dorr Machine Translation Divergences (24) (i) (ii) Lexical entry for enter: [Event GOLoc ([Thing W], [Path TOLoc ([Position INLoc ([Thing W], [Location * Z])])])] Lexical entry for entrar: [Event GOLoc ([Thing W], [Path * TOLoc ([Position INcoc ([Thing W], [Location Z])])])] Because the English entry contains a * marker in the [Location Z[ position, this constituent is realized on the surface as the object (i.e., the house) of the main verb.
  By contrast, the ?
  marker is associated with a "higher" position [Path TOcoc ...] in the Spanish entry, thus forcing this constituent to have a more complex realization (i.e., en la casa) in the syntactic structure.
  The general solution to structural divergence is diagrammed as follows: (25) RLCS
