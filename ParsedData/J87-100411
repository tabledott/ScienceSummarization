tands for *det throughout this paper.
    Since the sentence is 14-way ambiguous, the stack has been split into 14 stacks.
    For example, the sixth stack (05 1 *p 6 NP 11 *p 6) is in the status where I saw a man on the bed has been reduced into S, and the apartment has been reduced into NP.
    From the LR parsing table, we know that the top of the stack, state 6, is expecting *det or *n and eventually a NP.
    Thus, after a telescope comes in, a PP with a telescope will be formed, and the PP will modify the NP the apartment, and in the apartment will modify the S I saw a man.
    We notice that some stacks in the stack list appear to be identical.
    This is because they have reached the current state in different ways.
    For example, the sixth and seventh stacks are identical, because I saw a man on the bed has been reduced into S in two different ways.
    A disadvantage of the stack list method is that there are no interconnections between stacks (processes), and there is no way in which a process c
