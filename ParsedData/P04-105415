o et al. (2003) have shown the contiguous kernel to be computable in O(mn) and the sparse kernel in O(mn3), where m and n are the number of children in trees T1 and T2 respectively.
  
  
    We extract relations from the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) corpus provided by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).
    The data consists of about 800 annotated text documents gathered from various newspapers and broadcasts.
    Five entities have been annotated (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, GEO-POLITICAL ENTITY, LOCATION, FACILITY), along with 24 types of relations (Table 2).
    As noted from the distribution of relationship types in the training data (Figure 3), data imbalance and sparsity are potential problems.
    In addition to the contiguous and sparse tree kernels, we also implement a bag-of-words kernel, which treats the tree as a vector of features over nodes, disregarding any structural information.
    We also create composite kernels by combining the sparse and contiguous kernels with t
