    See Collins (2002a, 2002b) and Collins and Duffy (2001, 2002) for applications of the perceptron algorithm.
    Collins (2002b) gives convergence proofs for the methods; Collins (2002a) directly compares the boosting and perceptron approaches on a named entity task; and Collins and Duffy (2001, 2002) use a reranking approach with kernels, which allow representations of parse trees or labeled sequences in very-high-dimensional spaces.
    Shen, Sarkar, and Joshi (2003) describe support vector machine approaches to ranking problems and apply support vector machines (SVMs) using tree-adjoining grammar (Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi 1975) features to the parsing data sets we have described in this article, with good empirical results.
    See Collins (2004) for a discussion of many of these methods, including an overview of statistical bounds for the boosting, perceptron, and SVM methods, as well as a discussion of the computational issues involved in the different algorithms.
