 at the main word class level, i.e., after the removal of all attributes and ditto tag markers.
    All results are listed in Table 12.
    The three major horizontal blocks each represent a level at which the correctness of the final output is measured.
    Within the lower two blocks, the three rows represent the type of tags used by the base taggers.
    The rows for Wotan and WotanLite represent the actual taggers, as described above.
    The row for BestLite does not represent a real tagger, but rather a virtual tagger that corresponds to the best tagger from among Wotan (with its output projected to WotanLite format) and WotanLite.
    This choice for the best granularity is taken once for each system as a whole, not per individual token.
    This leads to BestLite being always equal to WotanLite for TBL and MBT, and to projected Wotan for MXP and HMM.
    The three major vertical blocks represent combination strategies: no combination, combination using only the tags, and combination using tags and dir
