    We believe that all these resources can positively contribute to develop inference mechanisms for multilingual data.
    Content synchronization represents a challenging application scenario to test the capabilities of advanced NLP systems.
    Given two documents about the same topic written in different languages (e.g.
    Wiki pages), the task consists of automatically detecting and resolving differences in the information they provide, in order to produce aligned, mutually enriched versions of the two documents.
    Towards this objective, a crucial requirement is to identify the information in one page that is either equivalent or novel (more informative) with respect to the content of the other.
    The task can be naturally cast as an entailment recognition problem, where bidirectional and unidirectional entailment judgments for two text fragments are respectively mapped into judgments about semantic equivalence and novelty.
    Alternatively, the task can be seen as a machine translation evaluatio
