unambiguous words on each side of the ambiguous word to which the rule is being applied.
    This constraint was determined as follows: In order to create the original inventory of Context Frame Tests, a 900-sentence subset of the Brown University Corpus was tagged.
    .
    . and its ambiguities were resolved manually; then a program was run which produced and sorted all possible Context Frame Rules which would have been necessary to perform this disambiguation automatically.
    The rules generated were able to handle up to three consecutive ambiguous words preceded and followed by two non-ambiguous words [a constraint similar to Klein and Simmons'].
    However, upon examination of these rules, it was found that a sequence of two or three ambiguities rarely occurred more than once in a given context.
    Consequently, a decision was made to examine only one ambiguity at a time with up to two unambiguously tagged words on either side.
    The first rules created were the results of informed intuition (Gree
