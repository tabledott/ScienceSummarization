nals and by adding the mapped version of the previously generated modifier, we have, in one fell swoop, incorporated the &#8220;no intervening&#8221; component of Collins&#8217; distance metric (the i = 0 case of the delta function) and achieved an estimate of the joint event of a conjunction and its conjuncts, albeit with different dependencies, that is, a different application of the chain rule.
    To put this parameterization change in sharp relief, consider the abstract tree structure To a first approximation, under the old parameterization, the conjunction of some node R1 with a head H and a parent P looked like this: &#710;pH(H  |P) &#183; &#710;pR(R1, coord=1  |P,H) &#183; &#710;pCC(CC  |P,H,R1) whereas under the new parameterization, it looks like this: Either way, the probability of the joint conditional event {H, CC, R1  |P} is being estimated, but with the new method, there is no need to add two new specialized parameter classes, and the new method does not introduce inconsistency into the model.
