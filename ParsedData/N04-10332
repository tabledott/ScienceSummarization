lization constant.
    As a decision rule, we obtain: This approach is a generalization of the source-channel approach.
    It has the advantage that additional models or feature functions can be easily integrated into the overall system.
    The model scaling factors &#955;M1 are trained according to the maximum entropy principle, e.g. using the GIS algorithm.
    Alternatively, one can train them with respect to the final translation quality measured by some error criterion (Och, 2003).
    The remaining part of this work is structured as follows: in the next section, we will describe the baseline phrase-based translation model and the extraction of bilingual phrases.
    Then, we will describe refinements of the baseline model.
    In Section 4, we will describe a monotone search algorithm.
    Its complexity is linear in the sentence length.
    The next section contains the statistics of the corpora that were used.
    Then, we will investigate the degree of monotonicity and present the translation resul
