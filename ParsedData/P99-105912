ch d2 has up to g possible senses.
    Each item now needs to track its head's sense along with its head's position in ID.
    Wherever an item formerly recorded a head position h (similarly h'), it must now record a pair (h, dh), where dh E VT is a specific sense of dh.
    No rule in Figures 1-2 (or Figure 3 below) will mention more than two such pairs.
    So the time complexity increases by a factor of 0(g2).
    7 Head automaton grammars in time 0(n4) In this section we show that a length-n string generated by a head automaton grammar (Alshawi, 1996) can be parsed in time 0(n4).
    We do this by providing a translation from head automaton grammars to bilexical CFGs.4 This result improves on the head-automaton parsing algorithm given by Alshawi, which is analogous to the CKY algorithm on bilexical CFGs and is likewise 0(n5) in practice (see &#167;3).
    A head automaton grammar (HAG) is a function H : a 1-4 Ha that defines a head automaton (HA) for each element of its (finite) domain.
    Let VT = domai
