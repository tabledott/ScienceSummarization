 approachis that it is easy to encode a wide range of poten tially useful information as features; for example,Clark (2002) has shown that POS tags provide use ful information for supertagging.
			The next section describes the set of lexical categories used by our supertagger and parser.
			2.1 The Lexical Category Set.
			The set of lexical categories is obtained from CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Hockenmaier, 2003), a corpus of CCG normal-form deriva tions derived semi-automatically from the PennTreebank.
			Following Clark (2002), we apply a fre quency cutoff to the training set, only using thosecategories which appear at least 10 times in sections 2-21.
			Figure 1 gives an example sentence su pertagged with the correct CCG lexical categories.
			Table 1 gives the number of different category types and shows the coverage on training (seen) anddevelopment (unseen) data (section 00 from CCGbank).
			The table also gives statistics for the com plete set containing every lexical category type inCC
