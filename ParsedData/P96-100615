h containing an occurrence of the noun &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; (or its plural form &amp;quot;interests&amp;quot;) with its correct sense manually tagged.
    The noun &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; occurs in six different senses in this data set.
    Table 2 shows the distribution of sense tags from the data set that we obtained.
    Note that the sense definitions used in this data set are those from Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978).
    This does not pose any problem for LEXAS, since LEXAS only requires that there be a division of senses into different classes, regardless of how the sense classes are defined or numbered.
    POS of words are given in the data set, as well as the bracketings of noun groups.
    These are used to determine the POS of neighboring words and the verb-object syntactic relation to form the features of examples.
