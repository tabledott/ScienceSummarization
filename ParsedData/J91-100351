by a frame-matching algorithm.
    The frame-matching algorithm matches the sets of cells from two senseframes.
    The sets of cells, which need not be ordered, are inherited down the sensenetwork.
    A series of structural constraints isolate pairs of cells that are matched using the graph search algorithm.
    Network paths are then sought between terms occupying identical positions in those cells.
    Seven kinds of cell match are distinguished, based on the structural constraints and types of network path found.
    Ancestor and same are &amp;quot;inclusive&amp;quot; cell matches, e.g.
    [compositionl, metal]] includes [composition1, steell] because the class of metals includes the class of steels (another ancestor relationship).
    Sister, descendant, and estranged are types of &amp;quot;exclusive&amp;quot; cell matches, e.g.
    [composition1, stee11] and [compositionl, aluminium1] are exclusive because the class of steels does not include the class of aluminiums since both belong to the class of m
