 improve the performance of a corpus-based coreference resolution system, we expand the Soon et al. feature set from 12 features to an arguably deeper set of 53.
    We propose additional lexical, semantic, and knowledge-based features; most notably, however, we propose 26 additional grammatical features that include a variety of linguistic constraints and preferences.
    Although the use of similar knowledge sources has been explored in the context of both pronoun resolution (e.g.
    Lappin and Leass (1994)) and NP coreference resolution (e.g.
    Grishman (1995), Lin (1995)), most previous work treats linguistic constraints as broadly and unconditionally applicable hard constraints.
    Because sources of linguistic information in a learning-based system are represented as features, we can, in contrast, incorporate them selectively rather than as universal hard constraints.
    Our results using an expanded feature set are mixed.
    First, we find that performance drops significantly when using the full
