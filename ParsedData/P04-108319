wise.
    Third, we assume that the word-to-word translation probabilities are independent of anything else: ,s where the latter probability can be looked up in our -PMTG.
    For the unstructured components, there are no useful nonterminal labels.
    Therefore, we assume that the unstructured components use only one (dummy) nonterminal label , so that if and undefined otherwise for .
    Our treatment of nonterminal productions begins These probabilities can be obtained from our wordto-word translation model, which would typically be estimated under exactly such an independence assumption.
    Finally, we assume that the output role templates are independent of each other and uniformly distributed, up to some maximum cardinality .
    Let be the number of unique role templates of cardinality or less.
    Then if and 0 otherwise.
    We can use these definitions of the grammar terms in the inference rules of Logic C to synchronize multitexts into multitreebanks.
