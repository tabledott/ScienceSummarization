al characters to be the baseline lexicon, and it successively adds items to the lexicon if the items will be useful in creating a better compression of the corpus in question, or rather, when the improvement in compression yielded by the addition of a new item to the codebook is greater than the length (or &amp;quot;cost&amp;quot;) associated with the new item in the codebook.
    In general, a lexical item of frequency F can be associated with a compressed length of &#8212; log F, and de Marcken's algorithm computes the compressed length of the Viterbi-best parse of the corpus, where the compressed length of the whole is the sum of the compressed lengths of the individual words (or hypothesized chunks, we might say) plus that of the lexicon.
    In general, the addition of chunks to the lexicon (beginning with such high-frequency items as th) will improve the compression of the corpus as a whole, and de Marcken shows that successive iterations add successively larger pieces to the lexicon.
