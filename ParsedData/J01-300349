three-way classification&#8212;is 33.9%.
    In the single hold-out methodology, there are 59 test cases, with 20, 19, and 20 verbs each from the unergative, unaccusative, and object-drop classes, respectively.
    Chance performance of picking a single class label as a default and assigning it to all cases would yield at most 20 out of the 59 cases correct, or 33.9%.
    For the cross-validation methodology, the determination of a baseline is slightly more complex, as we are testing on a random selection of 10% of the full data set in each run.
    The 33.9% figure represents the expected relative proportion of a test set that would be labelled correctly by assignment of a default class label to the entire test set.
    Although the precise make-up of the test cases vary, on average the test set will represent the class membership proportions of the entire set of verbs.
    Thus, as with the single hold-out approach, chance accuracy corresponds to a maximum of 20/59, or 33.9%, of the test set being labelled
