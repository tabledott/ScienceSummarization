taching to the parent with an attach action.1 A complete parse consists of a sequence of these actions, d1,..., dm, such that performing d1,..., dm results in a complete phrase structure tree.
    Because this mapping from phrase structure trees to sequences of decisions about parser actions is one-to-one, finding the most probable phrase structure tree is equivalent to finding the parse d1,..., dm which maximizes P(d1,..., dm|w1,..., wn).
    This probability is only nonzero if yield(d1,..., dm) = w1,..., wn, so we can restrict attention to only those parses which actually yield the given sentence.
    With this restriction, it is equivalent to maximize P(d1,..., dm), as is done with our first probability model.
    The first probability model is generative, because it specifies the joint probability of the input sentence and the output tree.
    This joint probability is simply P(d1,..., dm), since the 'More details on the mapping to parses can be found in (Henderson, 2003b). probability of the input senten
