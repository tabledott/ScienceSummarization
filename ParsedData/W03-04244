han 5 times in the training data.
    The first two kinds of features encode prefixes and suffixes less than length 5, and the remaining rare word features encode other morphological characteristics.
    These features are important for tagging unknown and rare words.
    The remaining features are the word, POS tag, and NE tag history features, using a window size of 2.
    Note that the NEi&#8722;2NEi&#8722;1 feature is a composite feature of both the previous and previous-previous NE tags.
    Table 2 lists the extra features used in our final system.
    These features have been shown to be useful in other NER systems.
    The additional orthographic features have proved useful in other systems, for example Carreras et al. (2002), Borthwick (1999) and Zhou and Su (2002).
    Some of the rows in Table 2 describe sets of contextual predicates.
    The wi is only digits predicates apply to words consisting of all digits.
    They encode the length of the digit string with separate predicates for lengths 1&#8
