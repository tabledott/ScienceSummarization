uilt compositionally by combining the meanings of its constituents.
    DSMs have so far focused on representing lexical meaning, and compositional and logical issues have either remained out of the picture, or have received still unsatisfactory accounts.
    A general consensus exists on the need to overcome this limitation, and to build new bridges between corpus-based semantics and symbolic models of meanings (Clark and Pulman 2007; Widdows 2008).
    Most problems encountered by DSMs in tackling this challenge are specific instances of more general issues concerning the possibility of representing symbolic operations with distributed, vector-based data structures (Markman 1999).
    Many avenues are currently being explored in corpus-based semantics, and interesting synergies are emerging with research areas such as neural systems (Smolensky 1990; Smolensky and Legendre 2006), quantum information (Widdows and Peters 2003; Aerts and Czachor 2004; Widdows 2004; Van Rijsbergen 2004; Bruza and Cole 2005; Hou
