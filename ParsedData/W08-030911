mount of time it takes to collect the different kinds of judgments.
    Our analysis is presented in Section 7.
    Ranking translations relative to each other is a relatively intuitive and straightforward task.
    We therefore kept the instructions simple.
    The instructions for this task were: 4It took 26 seconds on average to assign fluency and adequacy scores to a single sentence, and the inter-annotator agreement had a Kappa of between .225&#8211;.25, meaning that annotators assigned the same scores to identical sentences less than 40% of the time.
    Rank each whole sentence translation from Best to Worst relative to the other choices (ties are allowed).
    Ranking several translations at a time is a variant of force choice judgments where a pair of systems is presented and an annotator is asked &#8220;Is A better than B, worse than B, or equal to B.&#8221; In our experiments, annotators were shown five translations at a time, except for the Hungarian and Czech language pairs where there were fewer
