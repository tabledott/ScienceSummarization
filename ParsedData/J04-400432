enerated with two boolean flags: coord, indicating that the nonterminal is conjoined to the head via a CC, and punc, indicating that the nonterminal is conjoined to the head via a punctuation mark.
    When either or both of these flags is true, the intervening punctuation or conjunction is generated via appropriate instances of the Ppun,/PCC parameter classes.
    For example, the model generates the five children in Figure 9 in the following order: first, the head-child is generated, which is the leftmost NP (short grass), conditioning on the parent label and the headword and tag.
    Then, since modifiers are always generated from the head outward, the right-sibling of the head, which is the tall trees NP, is generated with both the punc and CC flags false.
    Then, the rightmost NP (bushy bushes) is generated with both the punc and CC booleans true, since it is considered to be conjoined to the head-child and requires the generation of an intervening punctuation mark and conjunction.
    Finally, the int
