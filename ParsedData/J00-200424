mparable to methods that simply count each lexicon entry as either right or wrong (e.g., Daille, Gaussier, and Lange 1994; Melamed 1996b).
    A weighted precision estimate pays more attention to entries that are more frequent and hence easier to estimate.
    Therefore, weighted precision estimates are generally higher than unweighted ones.
    Most probabilistic translation model reestimation algorithms published to date are variations on the theme proposed by Brown et al. (1993b).
    These models involve conditional probabilities, but they can be compared to symmetric models if the latter are normalized by the appropriate marginal distribution.
    I shall review these models using the notation in Table 1. ploy the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) to estimate the parameters of their Model 1.
    On iteration i, the EM algorithm reestimates the model parameters transi(vju) based on their estimates from iteration i &#8212; 1.
    In Model 1, the relationship between
