    The sentences are picked from the data sets presented in Section 4.2.

    The second concerns pairs in which the two sentences convey different amounts of information.
    In such pairs, one of the sentences contains a transSizes of the Chinese-English corpora extracted using bootstrapping, in millions of English tokens.
