as described in Section 6 Since we developed our methods to improve on this metric, it comes as no surprise that the most sophisticated method that employs splitting knowledge from a parallel corpus and information about POS tags proves to be superior with 99.1% accuracy.
    Its main remaining source of error is the lack of training data.
    For instance, it fails on more obscure words such as Passagier&#8212;auficommen (English: passenger volume), where even some of the parts have not been seen in the training corpus.
    The immediate purpose of our work is to improve the performance of statistical machine translation systems.
    Hence, we use the splitting methods to prepare training and testing data to optimize the performance of such systems.
    First, we measured the impact on a word based statistical machine translation system, the widely studied IBM Model 4 [Brown et al., 1990], for which training tools [Al-Onaizan et al., 19991 and decoders [Germann et al., 2001] are freely available.
