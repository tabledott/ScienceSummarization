    For each such sentence in the set, we included the sentence that immediately precedes it in the text (when the preceding sentence does not contain a pronoun).'
    We filtered the test set so that for each pronoun occurrence in the set, (i) RAP generates a candidate list with at least two elements, (ii) the actual antecedent NP appears in the candidate list, and (iii) there is a total tuple frequency greater than 1 for the candidate See Dagan 1992 and Dagan et al.

    16 In the interests of simplicity and uniformity we discarded sentence pairs in which the first sentence contains a pronoun.
    We decided to limit the text preceding the sentence containing the pronoun to one sentence because we found that in the manuals which we used
