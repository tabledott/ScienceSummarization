 vector 4)(x, y) and the parameter vector a.
    We used the algorithm depicted in Algorithm 1 to tune the parameter vector a.
    To alleviate overfitting on the training examples, we use the refinement strategy called &#8220;averaged parameters&#8221; (Collins, 2002) to the algorithm in Algorithm 1.
  
  
    In theory, any useful knowledge can be incorporated into the perceptron directly, besides the characterbased features already adopted.
    Additional features most widely used are related to word or POS ngrams.
    However, such features are generated dynamically during the decoding procedure so that the feature space enlarges much more rapidly.
    Figure 2 shows the growing tendency of feature space with the introduction of these features as well as the character-based ones.
    We noticed that the templates related to word unigrams and bigrams bring to the feature space an enlargement much rapider than the character-base ones, not to mention the higher-order grams such as trigrams or 4-grams.
