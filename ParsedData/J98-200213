 is in the tree cut, such as bee, the probability is given as explicitly specified by the model, i.e., P( bee I fly, arg1) = 0.2.
    For any class in the tree cut, the probability is distributed uniformly to all nouns dominated by it.
    For example, since there are four nouns that fall under the class BIRD, and swallow is one of them, the probability of swallow is thus given by PA:4(swallow I fly, arg1) = 0.8/4 -= 0.2.
    Note that the probabilities assigned to the nouns under BIRD are smoothed, even if the nouns have different observed frequencies.
    We have thus formalized the problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot as that of estimating a model from the class of tree cut models for some fixed thesaurus tree; namely, selecting a model that best explains the data from among the class of tree cut models.
  
  
    The question now becomes what strategy (criterion) we should employ to select the best tree-cut model.
    We adopt the Minimum Description Length principle (Rissanen 1978, Number
