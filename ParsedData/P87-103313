Person : 3, and the hypothesized description has ri&lt; Subj &gt;,&lt; Goal &gt;1, along with Subj : Person : 2.
    Therefore, since there is no compatible disjunct among (3) and (4), the hypothesis that (1) is compatible with the rest of the description has been shown to be invalid, and (1) can be eliminated.
    It follows that disjunct (2) should be unified with the definite part of the description.
    Now disjuncts (3) and (4) are checked for compatibility with the definite component of the new description: (3) is no longer compatible, but (4) is compatible.
    Therefore, (3) is eliminated, and (4) is unified with the definite information.
    No disjunctions remain in the result, as shown in Figure 10.
  
  
    Referring to Figure 3, note that the function UNIFY-DESC may terminate after any of the three major steps.
    After each step it may detect inconsistency between the two descriptions and terminate, returning failure, or it may terminate because no disjunctions remain in the description.
