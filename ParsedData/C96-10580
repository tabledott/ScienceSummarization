  upenn, edu Abstract Alter presenting a novel O(n a) parsing al- gorithm for dependency grammar, we de- velop three contrasting ways to stochasticize it.
  We propose (a) a lexical atfinity mode] where words struggle to modify each other, (b) a sense tagging model where words tluc- tuate randomly in their selectional prefer- ences, and (e) a. generative model where the speaker fleshes ()tit each words syntactic and concep{.ual structure without regard to the implications :for the hearer.
  also give preliminary empirical results from evaluat- ing the three models p;Lrsing performance on annotated Wall Street Journal trMning text (derived fiom the Penn Treebank).
  in these results, the generative model performs significantly better than the others, and does about equ
