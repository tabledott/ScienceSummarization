ly outputs pairs of paths that have some semantic relation.
    We used these as our set to extract finergrained relations.
  
  
    In this section, we empirically evaluate the accuracy of VERBOCEAN1.
    We studied 29,165 pairs of verbs.
    Applying DIRT to a 1.5GB newspaper corpus2, we extracted 4000 paths that consisted of single verbs in the relation subject-verb-object (i.e. paths of the form &amp;quot;X verb Y&amp;quot;) whose verbs occurred in at least 150 documents on the Web.
    For example, from the 20 most associated paths to &amp;quot;X solves Y&amp;quot; shown in Section 4.4, the following verb pairs were extracted: We classified each verb pair according to the semantic relations described in Section 2.
    If the system does not identify any semantic relation for a verb pair, then the system tags the pair as having no relation.
    To evaluate the accuracy of the system, we randomly sampled 100 of these verb pairs, and presented the classifications to two human judges.
