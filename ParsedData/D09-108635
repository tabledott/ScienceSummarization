rom better English parsing or from joint Chinese-English inference. having twice as much data in the target language.
    Note that the penalty for using automatic alignments instead of gold alignments is negligible; in fact, using Source text alone is often higher than +Gold alignments.
    Using gold source trees, however, significantly outperforms using 1-best source trees.
    (Hwa et al., 2005).
    The methods presented here move parser projection much closer in efficiency and simplicity to monolingual parsing.
    We showed that augmenting a target parser with quasi-synchronous features can lead to significant improvements&#8212;first in experiments with adapting to different dependency representations in English, and then in cross-language parser projection.
    As with many domain adaptation problems, it is quite helpful to have some annotated target data, especially when annotation styles vary (Dredze et al., 2007).
    Our experiments show that unsupervised QG projection improves on parsers trained
