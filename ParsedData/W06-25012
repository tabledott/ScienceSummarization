s such as word sense disambiguation (Patwardhan et al., 2003), real-word spelling correction (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001) and information extraction (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005), among others.
    In this paper we introduce a WordNet-based measure of semantic relatedness inspired by Harris&#8217; Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1985).
    The distributional hypothesis suggests that words that are similar in meaning tend to occur in similar linguistic contexts.
    Additionally, numerous studies (Carnine et al., 1984; Miller and Charles, 1991; McDonald and Ramscar, 2001) have shown that context plays a vital role in defining the meanings of words.
    (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) describe a context vector-based method that simulates learning of word meanings from raw text.
    (Sch&#168;utze, 1998) has also shown that vectors built from the contexts of words are useful representations of word meanings.
    Our Gloss Vector measure of semantic relatedness is based on second order co&#8211;occurrence vector
