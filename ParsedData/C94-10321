s on stochastic Japanese morphological nalysis [9, 12, 14], and they dont seem to have convinced the Japanese NLP community that the statistically-based teclmiques are superior to conventional rule-based tech- niques uch as [16, 17].
  We show in this paper that we can buihl a stochastic Japanese morphological nalyzer that offers approxi- mately 95% accuracy on a statistical language model- ing technique and an efficient two-pass N-best search strategy.
  We used tile simple tri-POS model as the tagging model for Japanese.
  Probability estimates were ob- tained after training on the ATI{ l)ialogue Database [5], whose word segmentation a d part of speech tag assignment were laboriously performed by hand.
  We propose a novel search strategy for getting the N best morphological nalysis hypotheses for the in- put sentence.
  It consists of the forward dynamic pro- gramming search and the backward A* search.
  The proposed algorithm amalgamates and extends three well-known algorithms in different fields: the Min
