a single packed data structure that represents in one place the substructures shared by several different interpretations.
    The transfer component operates on these packed representations and modifies the parser output to produce reduced f-structures.
    The reduced f-structures are then filtered by the generator to determine syntactic well-formedness.
    A stochastic disambiguator using a maximum entropy model is trained on parsed and manually disambiguated f-structures for pairs of sentences and their condensations.
    Using the disambiguator, the string generated from the most probable reduced f-structure produced by the transfer system is chosen.
    In contrast to the approaches mentioned above, our system guarantees the grammaticality of generated strings through the use of a constraint-based generator for LFG which uses a slightly tighter version of the grammar than is used by the parser.
    As shown in an experimental evaluation, summarization quality of our system is high, due to the combinati
