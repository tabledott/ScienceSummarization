augmenting the LeftArc and RightArc actions with the set of dependency labels.
    Hence our work is in line with Titov and Henderson (2007) in using labeled transitions with global learning.
    Moreover, we will see that label information can actually improve link accuracy.
  
  
    At each step during a parsing process, the parser configuration can be represented by a tuple (S, N, A), where S is the stack, N is the queue of incoming words, and A is the set of dependency arcs that have been built.
    Denoting the top of stack w &#8211; word; p &#8211; POS-tag; vl, vr &#8211; valency; l &#8211; dependency label, sl, sr &#8211; labelset. with S0, the front items from the queue with N0, N1, and N2, the head of S0 (if any) with S0h, the leftmost and rightmost modifiers of S0 (if any) with S0l and S0r, respectively, and the leftmost modifier of N0 (if any) with N0l, the baseline features are shown in Table 1.
    These features are mostly taken from Zhang and Clark (2008) and Huang and Sagae (2010), and our pa
