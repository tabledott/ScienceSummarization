h and Gale 1990), parsing (Debili 1982; Hindle and Rooth 1990).
    As pointed out by Bell, Witten, and Cleary (1989), these applications fall under two research paradigms: statistical approaches and lexical approaches.
    In the statistical approach, language is modeled as a stochastic process and the corpus is used to estimate probabilities.
    In this approach, a collocation is simply considered as a sequence of words (or n-gram) among millions of other possible sequences.
    In contrast, in the lexical approach, a collocation is an element of a dictionary among a few thousand other lexical items.
    Collocations in the lexicographic meaning are only dealt with in the lexical approach.
    Aside from the work we present in this paper, most of the work carried out within the lexical approach has been done in computer-assisted lexicography by Choueka, Klein, and Neuwitz (1983) and Church and his colleagues (Church and Hanks 1989).
    Both works attempted to automatically acquire true collocations from c
