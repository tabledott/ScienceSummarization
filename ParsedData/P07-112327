iderably higher than those obtained from the rule-based classifier (except for the precision of the subjective sentences).
    This is most likely due to the lexicon translation process, which as mentioned in the agreement study in Section 3.1, leads to ambiguity and loss of subjectivity.
    Instead, the corpus-based translations seem to better account for the ambiguity of the words, and the subjectivity is generally preserved in the sentence translations.
  
  
    In this paper, we described two approaches to generating resources for subjectivity annotations for a new language, by leveraging on resources and tools available for English.
    The first approach builds a target language subjectivity lexicon by translating an existing English lexicon using a bilingual dictionary.
    The second generates a subjectivity-annotated corpus in a target language by projecting annotations from an automatically annotated English corpus.
    These resources were validated in two ways.
    First, we carried out annotati
