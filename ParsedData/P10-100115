 span and a split point, Model 2 can be parsed in O(n4) time and O(n3) space.
    It should be noted that unlike Model 1, Model 2 produces grand-sibling parts only for the outermost pair of grandchildren,4 similar to the behavior of the Carreras (2007) parser.
    In fact, the resemblance is more than passing, as Model 2 can emulate the Carreras (2007) algorithm by &#8220;demoting&#8221; each third-order part into a second-order part: SCOREGS(x, g, h, m, s) = SCOREG(x, g, h, m) SCORETS(x, h, m, s, t) = SCORES(x, h, m, s) where SCOREG, SCORES, SCOREGS and SCORETS are the scoring functions for grandchildren, siblings, grand-siblings and tri-siblings, respectively.
    The emulated version has the same computational complexity as the original, so there is no practical reason to prefer it over the original.
    Nevertheless, the relationship illustrated above highlights the efficiency of our approach: we are able to recover third-order parts in place of second-order parts, at no additional cost.
