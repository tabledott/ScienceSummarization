erall list of partial hypotheses.
    Coverage pruning is carried out in a single run over the list of partial hypotheses: For each fragment corresponding to the same coverage set C, the coverage pruning threshold is applied.
    The partial hypotheses that survive the two pruning stages are then written into the so-called bookkeeping array (Ney et al. 1992).
    For the next expansion step, the set S is set to the newly generated list of hypotheses.
    Finally, the target translation is constructed from the bookkeeping array.
    3.9.2 Details for IBM-4 Model.
    In this section, we outline how the DP-based beam search approach can be carried out using the full set of IBM-4 parameters.
    (More details can be found in Tillmann [2001] or in the cited papers.)
    First, the full set of IBM-4 parameters does not make the simplifying assumption given in Section 3.1, namely, that source and target sentences are of equal length: Either a target word e may be aligned with several source words (its fertility is
