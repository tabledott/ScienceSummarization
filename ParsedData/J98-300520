eneration problem by the fact that summarization is concerned with conveying the maximal amount of information within minimal space.
    This goal is achieved through two distinct subprocesses, conceptual and linguistic summarization.
    Conceptual summarization is a form of content selection.
    It must determine which concepts out of a large number of concepts in the input should be included in the summary.
    Linguistic summarization is concerned with expressing that information in the most concise way possible.
    We have worked on the problem of summarization of data within the context of three separate systems.
    STREAK (Robin and McKeown 1993; Robin 1994; Robin and McKeown 1995) generates summaries of basketball games, using a revision-based approach to summarization.
    It builds a first draft using fixed information that must appear in the summary (e.g., in basketball summaries, the score and who won and lost is always present).
    In a second pass, it uses revision rules to opportunistically
