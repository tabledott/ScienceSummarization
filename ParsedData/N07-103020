ective function (relative to the probability output by the classifier) while ensuring that the final assignments respect the signifance of what it is to be anaphoric or non-anaphoric.
  
  
    Table 2 summarizes the results for these different systems.
    Both ILP systems are significantly better than the baseline system COREF-PAIRWISE.
    Despite having lower precision than COREF-PAIRWISE, the COREF-ILP system obtains very large gains in recall to end up with overall f-score gains of 4.3%, 4.2%, and 3.0% across BNEWS, NPAPER, and NWIRE, respectively.
    The fundamental reason for the increase in recall and drop in precision is that COREF-ILP can posit multiple antecedents for each mention.
    This is an extra degree of freedom that allows COREFILP to cast a wider net, with a consequent risk of capturing incorrect antecedents.
    Precision is not completely degraded because the optimization performed by ILP utilizes the pairwise probabilities of mention pairs as weights in the objective function to make
