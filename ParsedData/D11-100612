.e., directly parsing the target language with the source language parser without relying on parallel corpora.
    This idea has been previously explored by Zeman and Resnik (2008) and recently by S&#248;gaard (2011).
    Because we use a mapping of the treebank specific part-of-speech tags to a common tagset, the performance of a such a system is easy to measure &#8211; simply parse the target language data set with a delexicalized parser trained on the source language data.
    We conducted two experiments.
    In the first, we assumed that the test set for each target language had gold part-of-speech tags, and in the second we used predicted part-of-speech tags from the projection tagger of Das and Petrov (2011), which also uses English as the source language.
    UAS for all sentence lengths without punctuation are given in Table 1.
    We report results for both the English direct transfer parser (en-dir.)
    as well as a baseline unsupervised grammar induction system &#8211; the dependency model with v
