o 92.3%.
    This is our final result on the 45-tagset, and we note that it is higher than previously reported results.
  
  
    Previously, researchers working on this task have also reported results for unsupervised tagging with a smaller tagset (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Toutanova and Johnson, 2008; Goldberg et al., 2008).
    Their systems were shown to obtain considerable improvements in accuracy when using a 17-tagset (a coarsergrained version of the tag labels from the Penn Treebank) instead of the 45-tagset.
    When tagging the same standard test corpus with the smaller 17-tagset, our method is able to achieve a substantially high accuracy of 96.8%, which is the best result reported so far on this task.
    The table in Figure 9 shows a comparison of different systems for which tagging accuracies have been reported previously for the 17-tagset case (Goldberg et al., 2008).
    The first row in the table compares tagging results when using a full dictionary (i.e., a lexic
