an argument precedes the target predicate it is a subject, otherwise it is an object9.
    It follows that a constituent is Arg0, i.e.
    CArg0 = 1, if only one feature at a time is 1, otherwise it is not an Arg0, i.e.
    CArg0 = 0.
    In other words, CArg0 = Position XOR Voice, which is the classical example of a non-linear separable function that becomes separable in a superlinear space (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000).
    After it was established that the best kernel for standard features is Kp3, we carried out all the other experiments using it in the kernel combinations.
    Table 2 and 3 show the single class (f1 measure) as well as multi-class classifier (accuracy) performance for PropBank and FrameNet respectively.
    Each column of the two tables refers to a different kernel defined in the previous section.
    The overall meaning is discussed in the following points: First, PAF alone has good performance, since in PropBank evaluation it outperforms the linear kernel (Kp1), 88.7% vs. 86.7% w
