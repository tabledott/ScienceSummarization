    Summing up, t-test &#8211; with a few exceptions around the first 5% of the data in the SLs &#8211; leads to the overall best precision results for high-frequency PNV data.
    Log-likelihood is second best but achieves the best results for highfrequency AdjN data. ence between the AMs for low-frequency data, except for co-occurrence frequency, which leads to worse results than all other measures.
    For AdjN data, the AMs at best lead to an improvement of factor 3 compared to random selection (when up to of the SL is examined, log-likelihood achieves precision values above 30%).
    Log-likelihood is the overall best measure for identifying AdjN collocations, except for coordinates between 15% and 20% where t-test outperforms log-likelihood.
    For PNV data, the curves of all measures (except for frequency) are nearly identical.
    Their precision values are not significantlylo different from the baseline obtained by random selection.
    In contrast to our expectation stated at the beginning o
