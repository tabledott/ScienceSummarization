relatively high performance of frame-level statistics indicates that the Minimal lattice for cross-frame generalization. frames defined by FrameNet are fine-grained enough to capture the relevant semantic similarities.
    This result is encouraging in that it indicates that a relatively small amount of data can be annotated for a few words in a semantic frame and used to train a system that can then bootstrap to a larger number of predicates.
    More difficult than the question of unseen predicates in a known frame are frames for which no training data are present.
    The 67 frames in the current data set cover only a fraction of the English language, and the high cost of annotation makes it difficult to expand the data set to cover all semantic domains.
    The FrameNet project is defining additional frames and annotating data to expand the scope of the database.
    The question of how many frames exist, however, remains unanswered for the time being; a full account of frame semantics is expected to incl
