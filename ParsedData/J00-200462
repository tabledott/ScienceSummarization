em to instances of any link type induced from a bitext and display these instances sorted by their contexts (e.g.
    Simard, Foster, and Perrault 1993).
    Given an incomplete link type, the lexicographer can usually reconstruct the complete link type from the contexts in the concordance.
    For example, if the model proposes an equivalence between irnmediatement and right, a bilingual concordance can show the lexicographer that the model was really trying to capture the equivalence between immediatement and right away or between immediatement and right now.
    I counted incomplete entries in a third category (entry type I).
    Whether links in this category should be considered correct depends on the application.
    Table 6 shows the distribution of correct lexicon entries among the types V. P and I.
    Figure 8 graphs the accuracy of the method against coverage, with 95% confidence intervals.
    The upper curve represents accuracy when incomplete links are considered correct, and the lower when they
