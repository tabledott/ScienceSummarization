  We place certain restrictions on the composition operations of LCFRS's, restrictions that are shared by the composition operations of the constrained grammatical systems that we have considered.
    The operations must be linear and nonerasing, i.e., they can not duplicate or erase structure from their arguments.
    Notice that even though IG's and LFG's involve CFG-like productions, they are (linguistically) fundamentally different from CFG's because the composition operations need not be linear.
    By sharing stacks (in IG's) or by using nonlinear equations over f-structures (in FUG's and LFG's), structures with unbounded dependencies between paths can be generated.
    LCFRS's share several properties possessed by the class of mildly context-sensitive formalisms discussed by Joshi (1983/85).
    The results described in this paper suggest a characterization of mild context-sensitivity in terms of generalized context-freeness.
    Having defined LCFRS's, in Section 4.2 we established the semilinearity (
