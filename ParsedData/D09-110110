    Our ranking model, on the other hand, is trained without such features.
    More recently, Yang et al. (2008) have proposed another entity-mention model trained by inductive logic programming.
    Like their previous work, the scarcity of clusterlevel predicates (only two are used) under-exploits the expressiveness of entity-mention models.
    Mention ranking.
    The notion of ranking candidate antecedents can be traced back to centering algorithms, many of which use grammatical roles to rank forward-looking centers (see Grosz et al. (1995), Walker et al.
    (1998), and Mitkov (2002)).
    However, mention ranking has been employed in learning-based coreference resolvers only recently.
    As mentioned before, Denis and Baldridge (2008) train a mention-ranking model.
    Their work can be viewed as an extension of Yang et al.&#8217;s (2003) twin-candidate coreference model, which ranks only two candidate antecedents at a time.
    Unlike ours, however, their model ranks mentions rather than clusters
