decoder) that enables us to evaluate and compare various phrase translation methods.
    Our results show that phrase translation gives better performance than traditional word-based methods.
    We obtain the best results even with small phrases of up to three words.
    Lexical weighting ofphrase translation helps.
    Straight-forward syntactic models that map constituents into constituents fail to account for important phrase alignments.
    As a consequence, straight-forward syntax-based mappings do not lead to better translations than unmotivated phrase mappings.
    This is a challenge for syntactic translation models.
    It matters how phrases are extracted.
    The results suggest that choosing the right alignment heuristic is more important than which model is used to create the initial word alignments.
