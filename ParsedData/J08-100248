ions 22 and 23 were used as the development and final test sets, respectively.
    Following previous studies on parsing with PCFG-based models (Collins 1997; Charniak 2000), accuracy is measured for sentences of less than 40 words and for those with less than 100 words.
    Table 5 shows the specifications of the test data.
    The measure for evaluating parsing accuracy is precision/recall of predicate&#8211; argument dependencies output by the parser.
    A predicate&#8211;argument dependency is defined as a tuple (wh,wn,7t, p), where wh is the head word of the predicate, wn is the head word of the argument, 7t is the type of the predicate (e.g., adjective, intransitive verb), and p is an argument label (MODARG, ARG1, ..., ARG4).
    For example, He tried running has three dependencies as follows: Labeled precision/recall (LP/LR) is the ratio of tuples correctly identified by the parser, and unlabeled precision/recall (UP/UR) is the ratio of wh and wn correctly identified regardless of &#960; and p. F-scor
