			instances only occupy ~20% of cases, this explains why SPT performs better than the Context-Sensitive Path-enclosed Tree (CSPT) as described in Zhang et al(2006): consistently adopting CSPT may introduce too much noise/unnecessary information in the tree kernel.
			3.2 Context-Sensitive Convolution Tree Kernel.
			Given any tree span, e.g. the dynamic context sensitive tree span in the last subsection, we now study how to measure the similarity between two trees, using a convolution tree kernel.A convolution kernel (Haussler D., 1999) aims to capture structured information in terms of substructures . As a specialized convolution kernel, Collins and Duffy?s convolu tion tree kernel ),( 21 TTKC (?C? for convolution) counts the number of common sub-tre
