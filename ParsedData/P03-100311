    (ii) In order to have more variation of sentences containing the answer, we have automatically extended the first data set using the Web.
    For every TREC9-10 question/answer pair, we used our Web-based IR to retrieve sentences that overlap with the question terms and contain the answer.
    We call this data set TREC9-10Web.
    (iii) The third data set consists of 2381 question/answer pairs collected from http://www.quiz-zone.co.uk.
    We use the same method to automatically enhance this set by retrieving from the web sentences containing answers to the questions.
    We call this data set Quiz-Zone.
    Table 1 shows the size of the three training corpora: To train our QA noisy-channel model, we apply the algorithm described in Section 3.1 to generate training cases for all QA pairs in the three corpora.
    To help our model learn that it is desirable to copy answer words into the question, we add to each corpus a list of identical dictionary word pairs wiwi.
    For each corpus, we use GIZA (A
