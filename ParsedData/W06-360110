er two works).2 Our approach, in contrast, explicitly models the re-ordering of sub-trees within individual transfer rules.
  
  
    In this section, we define the formal machinery of our recursive transformation model as a special case of xRs transducers (Graehl and Knight, 2004) that has only one state, and each rule is linear (L) and non-deleting (N) with regarding to variables in the source and target sides (henth the name 1-xRLNs).
    We require each variable xi E X occurs exactly once in t and exactly once in s (linear and non-deleting).
    We denote &#961;(t) to be the root symbol of tree t. When writing these rules, we avoid notational overhead by introducing a short-hand form from Galley et al. (2004) that integrates the mapping into the tree, which is used throughout Section 1.
    Following TSG terminology (see Figure 2), we call these &#8220;variable nodes&#8221; such as x2:NP-C substitution nodes, since when applying a rule to a tree, these nodes will be matched with a sub-tree with the same r
