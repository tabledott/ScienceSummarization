ents show that this model obtains higher accuracy than classifiers trained in isolation as well as cascaded systems that pass information from one level to another at test time.
    Furthermore, extensions to the sentence-document model were discussed and it was argued that a nested hierarchical structure would be beneficial since it would allow for efficient inference algorithms.
