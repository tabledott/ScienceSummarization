 not look at particular linguistic phenomena in isolation; he or she must weigh the benefits of 'properly' handling these phenomena against the cost of implementing the proposed architecture.
    In the French pronoun case described by Danlos and Namer, for example, the applications builder might argue that in the great majority of cases no harm will in fact be done if the referring-expression generator simply ignores the possibility that pronouns may be abbreviated to l', especially given humans' ability to use context to disambiguate references; and if a situation does arise where it is absolutely essential that the human reader be able to correctly disambiguate a reference, then perhaps pronouns should not be used in any case.
    Given this, and the very high engineering cost of building an integrated architecture of the sort proposed by Danlos and Namer, is implementing such an architecture truly the most effective way of using scarce engineering resources?
