d mutual information between the history and the expansions (this was not appropriate for the horizontal case because MI is unreliable at such low counts).
    Figure 2 shows parsing accuracies as well as the number of symbols in each markovization.
    These symbol counts include all the intermediate states which represent partially completed constituents.
    The general trend is that, in the absence of further annotation, more vertical annotation is better &#8211; even exhaustive grandparent annotation.
    This is not true for horizontal markovization, where the variableorder second-order model was superior.
    The best entry, v = 3, h &lt; 2, has an F1 of 79.74, already a substantial improvement over the baseline.
    In the remaining sections, we discuss other annotations which increasingly split the symbol space.
    Since we expressly do not smooth the grammar, not all splits are guaranteed to be beneficial, and not all sets of useful splits are guaranteed to co-exist well.
    In particular, while v
