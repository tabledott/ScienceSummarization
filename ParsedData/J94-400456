be mapped to an internal argument position in cases in which a logical modifier is mapped to a syntactic head (i.e., the case of promotional divergence presented earlier), since there is no violation of the one-way relation.
  A similar argument is used to eliminate the case in which a logical head is mapped to an internal argument whose head corresponds toa logical argument (case 3.2).
  The idea is that heads and arguments participate in a one-way relation.
  If a logical head has an argument, he head cannot become an internal argument of that argument because the head-argument relation would be reversed (i.e., the logical head would be an argument of the syntactic head rather than the other way around).
  In contrast, he logical head of a CLCS can be mapped to an adjunct (i.e., modifier) position in cases in which a logical argument is mapped to a syntactic head (i.e., the case of demotional divergence presented earlier), since these is no violation of the one-way relation.
