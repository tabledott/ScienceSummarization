writing them.
			Besides obtaining useful data formodeling purposes, we also demonstrate that ab stractive compression is a meaningful task.
			We then present a tree-to-tree transducer capable of transforming an input parse tree into a compressed parse tree.
			Our approach is based on synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG, Eisner (2003)),a formalism that can account for structural mismatches, and is trained discriminatively.
			Specifi cally, we generalise the model of Cohn and Lapata (2007) to our abstractive task.
			We present a noveltree-to-tree grammar extraction method which acquires paraphrases from bilingual corpora and ensure coherent output by including a ngram language model as a feature.
			We also develop a number of loss functions suited to the abstractive compression task.
			We hope that some of the work described here might be of relevance to other gen eration tasks such as machine translation (Eisner, 2003), multi-document summarisation (Barzilay, 2003), and text simplification (Carr
