e to the wide-spread adoption of Minimum Error Rate Training or MERT (Och, 2003).
    However, MERT has trouble scaling to more than 30 features, which has led to a surge in research on tuning schemes that can handle high-dimensional feature spaces.
    These methods fall into a number of broad categories.
    Minimum risk approaches (Och, 2003; Smith and Eisner, 2006) have been quietly capable of handling many features for some time, but have yet to see widespread adoption.
    Online methods (Liang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007), are recognized to be effective, but require substantial implementation efforts due to difficulties with parallelization.
    Pairwise ranking (Shen et al., 2004; Hopkins and May, 2011) recasts tuning as classification, and can be very easy to implement, as it fits nicely into the established MERT infrastructure.
    The MERT algorithm optimizes linear weights relative to a collection of k-best lists or lattices, which provide an approximation to the true search space.
