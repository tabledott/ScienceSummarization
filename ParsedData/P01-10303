ame English word, then that English word is said to have a fertility of two.
    Likewise, if an English word remains unalignedto, then it has fertility zero.
    The word alignment in Figure 1 is shorthand for a hypothetical stochastic process by which an English string gets converted into a French string.
    There are several sets of decisions to be made.
    First, every English word is assigned a fertility.
    These assignments are made stochastically according to a table n( e).
    We delete from the string any word with fertility zero, we duplicate any word with fertility two, etc.
    If a word has fertility greater than zero, we call it fertile.
    If its fertility is greater than one, we call it very fertile.
    After each English word in the new string, we may increment the fertility of an invisible English NULL element with probability p(typically about 0.02).
    The NULL element ultimately produces &#8220;spurious&#8221; French words.
    Next, we perform a word-for-word replacement of Englis
