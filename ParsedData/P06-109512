mber of TLINKs goes up by more than 11 times, from 6147 Event-Event and 4593 Event-Time TLINKs to 91,157 EventEvent and 29,963 Event-Time TLINKs.
    The number of BEFORE links goes up from 3170 (51.6%) Event-Event and 1229 Event-Time TLINKs (26.75%) to 68585 (75.2%) EventEvent and 18665 (62.3%) Event-Time TLINKs, making BEFORE the majority class in the closed data for both Event-Event and Event-Time TLINKs.
    There are only an average of 0.84 TLINKs per event before closure, but after closure it shoots up to 9.49 TLINKs per event.
    (Note that as a result, the majority class percentages for the closed data have changed from the unclosed data.)
    Being able to bootstrap more training data is of course very useful.
    However, we need to dig deeper to investigate how the increase in data affected the machine learning.
    The improvement provided by temporal closure can be explained by three factors: (1) closure effectively creates a new classification problem with many more instances, providing more da
