 of morphological patterns (called signatures below), which aid both in quantifying the MDL account and in constructively building a satisfactory morphological grammar (for MDL offers no guidance in the task of seeking the optimal analysis).
    In addition, the system whose development is described here sets reasonably high goals: the reformulation in algorithmic terms of the strategies of analysis used by traditional morphologists.
    Developing an unsupervised learner using raw text data as its sole input offers several attractive aspects, both theoretical and practical.
    At its most theoretical, unsupervised learning constitutes a (partial) linguistic theory, producing a completely explicit relationship between data and analysis of that data.
    A tradition of considerable age in linguistic theory sees the ultimate justification of an analysis A of any single language L as residing in the possibility of demonstrating that analysis A derives from a particular linguistic theory LT, and that that LT wor
