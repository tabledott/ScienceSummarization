			The inverse projection constraint fails in thiscase, and in the experiments below, we relax this con straint and generate features for single source words as long as the target phrase has a gap less than 2English words.
			This relaxation allows a pair of ad jectives to modify the head noun.
			In future work we explore the use of features with variables to be filled at decode time.

			In order to con trast the performance of the extracted features, we compare the translation performance to (a) a system built from alignments proposed by an HMM Max Posterior Aligner, and
