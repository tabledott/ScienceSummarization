ase in the appropriate location to serve as the antecedent for an empty node, the syntactic structure is typically so distorted that either the pattern-matcher fails or the head-finding algorithm does not return the &#8220;correct&#8221; head either.

    This paper described a simple pattern-matching algorithm for restoring empty nodes in parse trees that do not contain them, and appropriately indexing these nodes with their antecedents.
    The patternmatching algorithm combines both simplicity and reasonable performance over the frequently occuring types of empty nodes.
    Performance drops considerably when using trees produced by the parser, even though this parser&#8217;s precision and recall is around 0.9.
