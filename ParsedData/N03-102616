 variants of the condensed sentence of Fig.
    2.
    The f-structures for these examples are similar to the f-structure assigned to the gold standard condensation shown in Fig.
    2 (except for the relations ADJUNT-TYPE:parenthetical versus ADV-TYPE:vpadv versus ADV-TYPE:sadv).
    An evaluation of summarization quality that is based on matching f-structures will treat these examples equally, whereas an evaluation based on string matching will yield different quality scores for different serializations.
    &amp;quot;A prototype, for testing, is ready.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;For testing, a prototype is ready.&amp;quot; In the next section, we present experimental results of an automatic evaluation of the sentence condensation system described above.
    These results show a close correspondence between automatically produced evaluation results and human judgments on the quality of generated condensed strings.
  
  
    The sentences and condensations we used are taken from data for the experiments of Knight a
