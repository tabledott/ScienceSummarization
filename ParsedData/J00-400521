inites (e.g., a company whose name is withheld), but it would exclude nonspecifically used indefinites such as at least n companies, most computational linguists.
    A more liberal approach along the lines of Kamp and Reyle (1993, Chapter 4), would predict that a quantifying NP such as the subject of Most computational linguists use a parser refers to the set of those computational linguists who use a parser: the VP helps to determine the referent of the NP.
    The first approach would make annotation easier to perform and the results would be likely to be more reliable as a result, but it would feed less information into the information extraction task.
    Trade-offs of this kind are unavoidable, and experimentation will be required to determine which option provides the best results.
    Secondly, we suggest a further division of labor whereby those phenomena that are no longer accounted for in the new TD are covered by other tasks (Kibble and van Deemter 2000).
    For example, the two NPs Henry Higgins
