eriments suggest that there is only a small difference between surface and structural cues.
    Comparing LR with surface cues and LR with structural cues as input, we find that they yield about the same performance: averages of 77.0% (surface) vs. 77.5% (structural) for all variables and 78.4% (surface) vs. 78.9% (structural) for selected variables.
    Looking at the independent binary decisions on a task-by-task basis, surface cues are worse in 10 cases Note.
    Numbers are the percentage of the evaluation subcorpus (N = 97) which were correctly assigned to the appropriate facet level: the Baseline column tells what percentage would be correct if the machine always guessed the most frequent level.
    LR is Logistic Regression, over our surface cues (Surf.) or Karlgren and Cutting's structural cues (Struct.
