e Adjoining grammars is presented in Section 3.
    Section 4 illustrates the goal of supertag disambiguation through an example.
    Various methods and their performance results for supertag disambiguation are discussed in detail in Section 5 and Section 6.
    In Section 7, we discuss the efficiency gained in performing supertag disambiguation before parsing.
    A robust and lightweight dependency analyzer that uses the supertag output is briefly presented in Section 8.
    In Section 9, we will discuss the applicability of supertag disambiguation to other lexicalized grammars.
  
  
    In recent years, there have been a number of attempts at robust parsing of natural language.
    They can be broadly categorized under two paradigms&#8212;finite-state-grammarbased parsers and statistical parsers.
    We briefly present these two paradigms and situate our approach to robust parsing relative to these paradigms.
    Finite-state-grammar-based approaches to parsing are exemplified by the parsing systems in J
