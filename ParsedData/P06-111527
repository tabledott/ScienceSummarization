s, 2000).As opposed to the other systems, KRISP?s stringkernel-based semantic parsing does not use hard matching rules and should be thus more flexible and robust to noise.
			We tested this hypothesis by running experiments on data which was artificiallycorrupted with simulated speech recognition er rors.
			The interjections, environment noise etc. are likely to be recognized as real words by a speech recognizer.
			To simulate this, after every word ina sentence, with some probability Padd, an extra word is added which is chosen with proba bility proportional to its word frequency found inthe British National Corpus (BNC), a good representative sample of English.
			A speech recog nizer may sometimes completely fail to detect words, so with a probability of Pdrop a word is sometimes dropped.
			A speech recognizer could also introduce noise by confusing a word with ahigh frequency phonetically close word.
