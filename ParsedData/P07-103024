they introduce strong connections between two different concepts.
    Thus, for fish we discovered that one of the all-toall relationships captures a precise set of fish body parts, and another captures swimming verbs.
    Such relations introduce strong and distinct connections between the concept of fish and the concepts of fishbody-parts and swimming.
    Such connections may be extremely useful for ontology construction.
