ot;/&amp;quot;pro&amp;quot; might also qualify but if the languages afford any example of a scientific preposition, this is surely it.
    The most interesting further developments would be in the direction of loosening up this dependence on one-to-one associations both because this would present a very significant challenge and also because we are convinced that our present method identifies essentially all the significant one-to-one associations.
    There are two obvious kinds of looser associations that could be investigated.
    One would consist of connections between a single vocabulary item in one language and two or more in the other, or even between several items in one language and several in the other.
    The other would involve connections&#8212;one&#8211;one, one&#8211;many, or many&#8211;many&#8212;between phrases or recurring sequences.
