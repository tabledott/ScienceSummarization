mize the likelihood of the unlexicalized (observed) training trees.
    To test this, we performed experiments with an initial model trained using an extremely simplified head-rule set in which all rules were of the form &#8220;if the parent is X, then choose the left/rightmost child.&#8221; A surprising side result was that even with this simplified set of head-rules, overall parsing performance still remained quite high.
    Using our simplified head-rule set for English, our engine in its &#8220;Model 2 emulation mode&#8221; achieved a recall of 88.55% and a precision of 88.80% for sentences of length &#8804;40 words in Section 00 (see Table 7).
    So contrary to our expectations, the lack of careful head-choice is not crippling in allowing the parser to disambiguate competing theories and is a further indication that semantic preferences, as represented by conditioning on a headword, rarely override structural ones.
    Given that bilexical dependencies are almost never used and have a surprisingly small
