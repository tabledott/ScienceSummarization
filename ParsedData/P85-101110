ode n. In this sense, adjoining is context-free.
  In [Jmhi ,19831, I~al  constraints on adjoining similar to those investigated by [Joshi and Levy ,1977] were considered.These are a generalization of the context-sensitive constraints tudied by [Peters and Ritchie ,1~9].
  It was soon recognized, however, that the full power of these constraints was never fully utilized, both in the linguistic context as well as in the "formal languages of TAGs.
  The so-called proper analysis contexts and domination contexts (as defined in [Jmhi and Levy ,197T]) as used in [Joshi ,1983J always turned out to be such that the context elements were always in a specific elementary tree i.e., they were further localized by being in the same elementary tree.
  Based on this observation and a suggestion in [Jaehi, Levy and Takahashi ,1975], we will deseribe a new way of introducing local constraints.
  This approach not only captures the insight stated above, but it is truly in the spirit of TAGs.
  The earlier approach was not so,
