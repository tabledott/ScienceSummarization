mostly sunny partly, cloudy increasing mostly cloudy, partly of inch an possible new a rainfall herence structure at both the record and field levels.
    To quantify the benefits of incorporating these two aspects, we compare our full model with two simpler variants. skyCover.mode in the weather domain.
    It is interesting to note that skyCover=75-100 is so highly correlated with rain that the model learns to connect an overcast sky in the world to the indication of rain in the text. separate multinomial distribution over words from which w is drawn.
    An example of a categorical field is skyCover.mode in the weather domain, which has four values: 0-25, 25-50, 50-75, and 75-100.
    Table 2 shows the top words for each of these field values learned by our model.
  
  
    Our learning and inference methodology is a fairly conventional application of Expectation Maximization (EM) and dynamic programming.
    The input is a set of scenarios D, each of which is a text w paired with a world state s. We maxim
