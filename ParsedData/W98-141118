dicates the position of the ith element of the sequence in that canonical sequence with all previous elements deleted.
    So the ith element is always a number between 1 and n 1 &#8212; i, where n is the length of the sequence.
    Mutation is implemented by a change of a random element to a random legal value.
    Crossover (here) is implemented by two-point crossover - the material between two random points of the sequences (the same points for both) is swapped over, yielding two new sequences.
    The ordinal representation has been used extensively for tasks such as the travelling salesman problem, and it has the advantage that the crossover operation is particularly simple.
    In many ways, this is a more obvious encoding, though the operations are chosen to reflect the intuition that order and adjacency information should generally be maintained from old solution(s) Figure 4 shows an example text produced using the path encoding operations (for j -342540, after 2000 iterations, just under 2 minutes, s
