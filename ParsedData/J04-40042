that head choice is not nearly as important to overall parsing performance as once thought.
    Finally, we perform experiments that show that the true discriminative power of lexicalization appears to lie in the fact that unlexicalized syntactic structures are generated conditioning on the headword and its part of speech.
  
  
    Michael Collins&#8217; (1996, 1997, 1999) parsing models have been quite influential in the field of natural language processing.
    Not only did they achieve new performance benchmarks on parsing the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), and not only did they serve as the basis of Collins&#8217; own future work (Collins 2000; Collins and Duffy 2002), but they also served as the basis of important work on parser selection (Henderson and Brill 1999), an investigation of corpus variation and the effectiveness of bilexical dependencies (Gildea 2001), sample selection (Hwa 2001), bootstrapping non-English parsers (Hwa, Resnik, and Weinberg 2002), and the automati
