he weighted mean yields the entropy of the full distribution, in this case .09 bits for the aid/aide ambiguity.
  For each type of collocation, we also compute how well an observed probability distribution predicts the correct classifi- cation for novel examples.
  In general, this is a more useful measure for most of the comparison purposes we will address.
  Not only does it reflect he underlying entropy of the distribu- tion, but it also has the practical advantage of showing how a working system would perform given this data.
  ALGORITHM The sense disambiguation algorithm used is quite straightfor- ward.
  When based on a single collocation type, such as the object of the verb or word immediately to the left, the pro- cedure is very simple.
  One identifies if this collocation type exists for the novel context and if the specific words found are listed in the table of probability distributions (as computed above).
  If so, we return the sense which was most frequent for that collocation in the training da
