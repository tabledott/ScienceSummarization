ity of automatic alignments would lead to more accurate paraphrases, and that there is room for improvement in limiting the paraphrases by their context.
    We address these points below.
    Work in statistical machine translation suggests that, like many other machine learning problems, performance increases as the amount of training data increases.
    Och and Ney (2003) show that the accuracy of alignments produced by Giza++ improve as the size of the training corpus increases.
    Since we used the whole of the German-English section of the Europarl corpus, we could not try improving the alignments by simply adding more German-English training data.
    However, there is nothing that limits our paraphrase extraction method to drawing on candidate paraphrases from a single target language.
    We therefore re-formulated the paraphrase probability to include multiple corpora, as follows: where C is a parallel corpus from a set of parallel corpora.
    For this condition we used Giza++ to align the French-
