ons of the two features.
    We basically M(&#183;) is maps a source span to the target language, and M&#8722;1(&#183;) is the reverse operation mapping back to the source language. map a source span sp to its target span M(sp), and check whether its reverse image back onto the source language M&#8722;1(M(sp)) falls inside the allowed span ap.
    For cR(st, wi), the allowed span extends to the right end of the sentence.5 To conclude so far, we have got two alignmentbased features, c(st&#8722;1, st) correlating with reduce, and cR(st, wi) correlating with shift.
    In fact, the conjunction of these two features, is another feature with even stronger discrimination power.
    If is a very strong signal for shift.
    So in total we got three bilingual feature (templates), which in practice amounts to 24 instances (after cross-product with {&#8722;, +} and the three actions).
    We show in Section 5.3 that these features do correlate with the correct shift/reduce actions in practice.
