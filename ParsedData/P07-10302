ce synonyms and other standard lexical relations.
    These relations comprise all those words that stand in some known binary relation with a specified word.
    In this paper, we introduce a novel extension of this problem: given a particular concept (initially represented by two seed words), discover relations in which it participates, without specifying their types in advance.
    We will generate a concept class and a variety of natural binary relations involving that class.
    An advantage of our method is that it is particularly suitable for web mining, even given the restrictions on query amounts that exist in some of today&#8217;s leading search engines.
    The outline of the paper is as follows.
    In the next section we will define more precisely the problem we intend to solve.
    In section 3, we will consider related work.
    In section 4 we will provide an overview of our solution and in section 5 we will consider the details of the method.
    In section 6 we will illustrate and evaluate t
