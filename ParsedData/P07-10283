 model.
    However, the EM-based clustering model has higher coverage than both other paradigms.
    Plan of the paper.
    After discussing previous approaches to selectional preference induction in Section 2, we introduce the similaritybased model in Section 3.
    Section 4 describes the data used for the experiments reported in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes.
  
  
    Selectional restrictions and selectional preferences that predicates impose on their arguments have long been used in semantic theories, (see e.g.
    (Katz and Fodor, 1963; Wilks, 1975)).
    The induction of selectional preferences from corpus data was pioneered by Resnik (1996).
    All subsequent approaches have followed the same twostep procedure, first collecting argument headwords from a corpus, then generalizing over the seen headwords to similar words.
    Resnik uses the WordNet noun hierarchy for generalization.
    His information-theoretic approach models the selectional preference strength of an argument positions rp of a
