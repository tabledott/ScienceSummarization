file rise to 92.1% of true L1 L2 pairs correctly identified, as compared to 86.4% for the pure length-based method.
    The improvement is entirely in the introductory session header.
    Without the header, the rate is 95.0% as compared to 95.2% earlier (the discrepancy is insignificant and is due to somewhat arbitrary decisions made on anomolous regions).
    Again, caution should be exercised in interpreting these percentages.
    By the alternative Type II measure, 96.1% of the output 1-for-1 pairs were true matches, compared to 86.1% using the pure length-based method.
    Again, there is an insignificant drop when the header is discarded, in this case from 96.3% down to 95.8%.
  
  
    Of our raw corpus data, we have currently aligned approximately 3.5Mb of combined English and Chinese texts.
    This has yielded 10,423 pairs classified as 1-for-1, which we are using to extract more refined information.
    This data represents over 0.217 million English words (about 1.269Mb) plus the corresponding Chi
