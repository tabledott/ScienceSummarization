			Lappin and Leass' algorithm for pronominal anaphora resolution is capable of high accuracy, but requires in- depth, full, syntactic parsing of text.
			The modifications of that algorithm that we have developed make it avail- able to a larger set of text processing frameworks, as we assume a considerably 'poorer' analysis ubstrate.
			While adaptations to the input format and interpreta- tion procedures have necessarily addressed the issues of coping with a less rich level of linguistic analysis, there is only a small compromise in the quality of the results.
			Our evaluation indicates that the problems with the current implementation donot stem from the absence of a parse, but rather from factors which can be addressed within the constraints imposed by the shallow base analysis.
			The overall success of the algo- rithm is important, then, not only for the immediate utility of the particular modifications, but also because the strategy we have developed for cir
