ome of the chosen scenarios will be better represented in the corpus than others, which may block learning of the under-represented scenarios.
    The scenarios that are represented well may be learned at different rates, which again may inhibit other learners.
    This effect is seen in Figure 2; the Lawsuit learner is inhibited by the other, stronger scenarios.
    The curve labeled Counter-Strong is obtained from a separate experiment.
    The Lawsuit learner ran against the same scenarios as in Table 1, but some of the other learners were &#8220;weakened&#8221;: they were given smaller seeds, and therefore picked up fewer documents initially.5 This enabled them to provide sufficient guidance to the Lawsuit learner to maintain high precision, without inhibiting high recall.
    The initial part of the curve is difficult to see because it overlaps largely with the Counter curve.
    However, they diverge substantially toward the end, above the 80% recall mark.
    We should note that the objective of the pr
