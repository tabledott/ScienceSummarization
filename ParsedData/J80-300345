ry to account for common forms of indirect REQUESTs and INFORMs remains to be done.
    This example shows how a completely non-standard form can be intended indirectly.
    Suppose that A tells (4.6a) &amp;quot;John asked me to ask you to leave&amp;quot; This has at least three possible interpretations: him to leave.
    Interpretations c and d can hold even if S decides that A actually does want him to leave.
    However, in these cases, he would not say that A intended to communicate the intent that he leave, i.e. he would not say the utterance was a REQUEST.

    They also require a new PC/PI rule: if A wants S to believe some proposition P, then A may get S to believe some proposition Q, as long as A believes that S believes that
