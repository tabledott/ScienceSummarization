    In graph-based learning approaches one constructs a graph whose vertices are labeled and unlabeled examples, and whose weighted edges encode the degree to which the examples they link have the same label (Zhu et al., 2003).
    Graph construction for structured prediction problems such as POS tagging is non-trivial: on the one hand, using individual words as the vertices throws away the context necessary for disambiguation; on the other hand, it is unclear how to define (sequence) similarity if the vertices correspond to entire sentences.
    Altun et al. (2005) proposed a technique that uses graph based similarity between labeled and unlabeled parts of structured data in a discriminative framework for semi-supervised learning.
    More recently, Subramanya et al. (2010) defined a graph over the cliques in an underlying structured prediction model.
    They considered a semi-supervised POS tagging scenario and showed that one can use a
