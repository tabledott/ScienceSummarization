described in section 3.4 when used on their own as defined in (3).
    The difference between them is fairly small, but appears to be consistent across LM and TM adaptation and (for the LM metrics) across source and target side matching.
    In general, LM metrics seem to have a slight advantage over the vector space metrics, with EM being the best overall.
    We focus on this metric for most of the experiments that follow. the NIST04-nw development set.
    (Entries in the top right corner are missing due to lack of time.)
    Table 4 shows the performance of the parameterized weighting function described by (4), with source-side EM and LSA metrics as inputs.
    This is compared to direct weight optimization, as both these techniques use Downhill Simplex for parameter tuning.
    Unfortunately, neither is able to beat the performance of the normalized source-side EM metric on its own (reproduced on the first line from table 3).
    In additional tests we verified that this also holds for the test corpus.
