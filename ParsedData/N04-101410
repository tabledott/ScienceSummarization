#8801; 11ni=1 wi, and call h leftmost if The reflexive, transitive closure of &#8658;G is written &#8658;&#8727;G (derives in G), and the restriction of &#8658;&#8727;G to leftmost derivation histories is &#8658;L&#8727; G (leftmost derives in G).
    The weight of a becoming b in G is wG (a, b) Eh:(a,())&#8658;c&#8727;(b,h) w(h), the sum of weights of all unique (leftmost) derivations transforming a to b, and the weight of t in G is WG(t) = wG(S,t).
    The weighted regular tree language produced by G is LG &#8801; {(t,w) &#8712; TE &#215; IIB+  |WG(t) = w}.
    For every weighted context-free grammar, there is an equivalent wRTG that produces its weighted derivation trees with yields being the string produced, and the yields of regular tree grammars are context free string languages (G&#233;cseg and Steinby, 1984).
    What is sometimes called a forest in natural language generation (Langkilde, 2000; Nederhof and Satta, 2002) is a finite wRTG without loops, i.e., &#8704;n &#8712; N(n, ()) &#8658;&#8727;G (t
