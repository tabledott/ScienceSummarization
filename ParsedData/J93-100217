 in CNF to efficiently select the most probable derivation of a given input.
    Kupiec (1991) extends Baum-Welch re-estimation to arbitrary (nonCNF) CFGs.
    Baum-Welch re-estimation can be used with restricted or unrestricted grammars/models in the sense that some of the parameters corresponding to possible productions over a given (non-)terminal category set/set of states can be given an initial probability of zero.
    Unrestricted grammars/models quickly become impractical because the number of parameters requiring estimation becomes large and these algorithms are polynomial in the length of the input and number of free parameters.
    Typically, in applications of Markov modeling in speech recognition, the derivation used to analyze a given input is not of interest; rather what is sought is the best (most likely) model of the input.
    In any application of these or similar techniques to parsing, though, the derivation selected is of prime interest.
    Baum (1972) proves that Baum-Welch re-estimation
