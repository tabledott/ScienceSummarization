 (2009). x.w and x.t denotes the root word and POS tag of tree (or word) x. and x.lc and x.rc denote x&#8217;s left- and rightmost child.
    (b) feature window.
    (c) kernel features.
    (i.e., same step) if they have the same feature values, because they will have the same costs as shown in the deductive system in Figure 1.
    Thus we can define two states (j, S) and (j&#8242;, S&#8242;) to be equivalent, notated (j, S) &#8212; (j&#8242;, S&#8242;), iff. j = j&#8242; and f(j, S) = f(j&#8242;, S&#8242;).
    (4) Note that j = j&#8242; is also needed because the queue head position j determines which word to shift next.
    In practice, however, a small subset of atomic features will be enough to determine the whole feature vector, which we call kernel features &#65533;f(j, S), defined as the smallest set of atomic templates such that For example, the full list of 28 feature templates in Table 1(a) can be determined by just 12 atomic features in Table 1(c), which just look at the root words and tags of th
