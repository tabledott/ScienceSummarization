tion of the DSP: specific linguistic markers, utterance-level intentions, and general knowledge about actions and objects in the domain of discourse.
    Each plays a part in the OCP's recognition of the DSP and can be utilized by the ICP to facilitate this recognition.
    Cue phrases are the most distinguished linguistic means that speakers have for indicating discourse segment boundaries and conveying information about the DSP.
    Recent evidence by Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (1986) suggests that certain intonational properties of utterances also provide partial information about the DSP relationships.

    For example, the word but functions as a boundary marker in utterance (7) of the discourse in Section 3.1, but it can also be used solely (as in the current utterance) to convey propositional content (e.g., the conj
