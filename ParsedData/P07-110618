e agenda size increases the decoding speed, but it could cause loss of accuracy by eliminating potentially good candidates.
    The agenda size also affects the training time, and resulting model, since the perceptron training algorithm uses the decoder output to adjust the model parameters.
    Table 3 shows the accuracies with ten different agenda sizes, each used for both training and testing.
    Accuracy does not increase beyond B = 16.
    Moreover, the accuracy is quite competitive even with B as low as 4.
    This reflects the fact that the best segmentation is often within the current top few candidates in the agenda.2 Since the training and testing time generally increases as N increases, the agenda size is fixed to 16 for the remaining experiments.
    Our CWS model is highly dependent upon word information.
    Most of the features in Table 1 are related to words.
    Table 4 shows the accuracy with various features from the model removed.
    Among the features, vocabulary words (feature 1) and l
