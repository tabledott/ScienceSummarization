ly by Strube and Ponzetto (2006) and Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007) to devise methods for computing semantic relatedness of documents, WikiRelate!
  and Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), respec- tively.
  For any pair of words, WikiRelate!
  attempts to find a pair of articles with titles that contain those words and then computes their relatedness from the word-based similarity of the articles and the distance between the articles?
  categories in the Wikipedia category tree.
  ESA works by first build- ing an inverted index from words to all Wikipedia articles that contain them.
  Then, it estimates a re- latedness score for any two documents by using the inverted index to build a vector over Wikipedia articles for each document and by computing the cosine similarity between the two vectors.
  
  They employed several of the disambiguation resources discussed in this paper (Wikipedia entity pages, redirection pages, categories, and hyperlinks) and built a context- article cosine similarity model and an S
