operation to be carried out using different resources, whereas we reinterpret it as a different way to use the same W1&#215;LW2 space in which we measure plausibility.
    Following Pad&#180;o and colleagues, we measure performance by the Spearman p correlation coefficient between the average human ratings and the model predictions, considering only verb&#8211;noun pairs that are present in the model.
    Table 7 reports percentage coverage and correlations for the DM models (the task requires the links to extract typical subjects and objects, so we cannot use DV nor Win), results from Pad&#180;o, Pad&#180;o, and Erk (2007) (ParCos is the best among their purely corpus-based systems), and the performance on the Pad&#180;o data set of the supervised system of Herda&#711;gdelen and Baroni (2009).
    Testing for significance of the correlation coefficients with two-tailed tests based on a Spearman-coefficient derived t statistic, we find that the Resnik&#8217;s model correlation for the McRae data is not signif
