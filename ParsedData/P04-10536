    Lin&#8217;s idea was that two verb phrases which have similar fillers might be regarded as paraphrases.
    This approach, however, also needs a sample verb phrase as an initial seed in order to find similar verb phrases.
  
  
    We propose a new approach to relation discovery from large text corpora.
    Our approach is based on context based clustering of pairs of entities.
    We assume that pairs of entities occurring in similar context can be clustered and that each pair in a cluster is an instance of the same relation.
    Relations between entities are discovered through this clustering process.
    In cases where the contexts linking a pair of entities express multiple relations, we expect that the pair of entities either would not be clustered at all, or would be placed in a cluster corresponding to its most frequently expressed relation, because its contexts would not be sufficiently similar to contexts for less frequent relations.
    We assume that useful relations will be fre
