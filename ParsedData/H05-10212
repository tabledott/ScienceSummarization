 al, 1993)describe word reordering via a distortion model de fined over word positions within sentence pairs.
			The Alignment Template Model (Och et al, 1999) usesphrases rather than words as the basis for transla tion, and defines movement at the level of phrases.
			Phrase reordering is modeled as a first order Markovprocess with a single parameter that controls the de gree of movement.
			Our current work is inspired by the block(phrase-pair) orientation model introduced by Tillmann (2004) in which reordering allows neighbor ing blocks to swap.
			This is described as a sequence of orientations (left, right, neutral) relative to themonotone block order.
			Model parameters are blockspecific and estimated over word aligned trained bi text using simple heuristics.
			Other researchers (Vogel, 2003; Zens and Ney, 2003; Zens et al, 2004) have reported performance gains in translation by allowing deviations from monotone word and phrase order.
