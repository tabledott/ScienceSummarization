  A Trainable Rule-Based Algorithm For Word Segmentation
  
    This paper presents a trainable rule-based algorithm for performing word segmentation.
    The algorithm provides a simple, language-independent alternative to large-scale lexical-based segmenters requiring large amounts of knowledge engineering.
    As a stand-alone segmenter, we show our algorithm to produce high performance Chinese segmentation.
    In addition, we show the transformation-based algorithm to be effective in improving the output of several existing word segmentation algorithms in three different languages.
  
  
    This paper presents a trainable rule-based algorithm for performing word segmentation.
    Our algorithm is effective both as a high-accuracy stand-alone segmenter and as a postprocessor that improves the output of existing word segmentation algorithms.
    In the writing systems of many languages, including Chinese, Japanese, and Thai, words are not delimited by spaces.
    Determining the word boundaries, thus tok
