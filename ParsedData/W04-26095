ts within the same phrase, and to analyze the meaning of these compounds.
    Several approaches have been proposed for empirical noun-compound interpretation, such as syntactic analysis based on statistical techniques (Lauer and Dras 1994), (Pustejovsky et al. 1993).
    Another popular approach focuses on the interpretation of the underlying semantics.
    Many researchers that followed this approach relied mostly on hand-coded rules (Finin 1980), (Uanderwende 1994).
    More recently, (Rosario and Hearst 2001), (Rosario, Hearst, and Fillmore 2002), (Lapata 2002) have proposed automatic methods that analyze and detect noun compounds relations from text.
    (Rosario and Hearst 2001) focused on the medical domain making use of a lexical ontology and standard machine learning techniques.
  
  
    We approach the problem top-down, namely identify and study first the characteristics or feature vectors of each noun phrase linguistic pattern, then develop models for their semantic classification.
