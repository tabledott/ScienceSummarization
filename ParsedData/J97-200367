recognition is greatly simplified when applied to W2 rather than Wi.
    W2 admits 38 states and 51 transitions.
    The transducer W2 can still be minimized.
    The minimization algorithm described in the previous section leads to the transducer W3 shown in Figure 20.
    It contains 25 states and 33 transitions and of course the same number of paths as W2, 18.
    The effect of minimization appears to be less important.
    This is because, in this case, determinization includes a large part of the minimization by reducing the size of the first lattice.
    This can be explained by the degree of nondeterminism of word lattices such as WI.'
    Many states can be reached by the same set of strings.
    These states are grouped into a single subset during determinization.
    Also, the complexity of determinization is exponential in general, but in the case of the lattices considered in speech recognition, it is not.16 Since they contain a lot of redundancy, the resulting lattice is smaller than the initial
