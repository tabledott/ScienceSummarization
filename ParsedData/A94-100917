tests were conducted in a similar manner to those of the first experiment, by building a lexicon and transitions from a hand tagged training corpus, and then applying them to a test corpus with varying degrees of degradation.
    Firstly, four different degrees of degradation were used: no degradation at all, D2 degradation of the lexicon, Ti degradation of the transitions, and the two together.
    Secondly, we selected test corpora with varying degrees of similarity to the training corpus: the same text, text from a similar domain, and text which is significantly different.
    Two tests were conducted with each combination of the degradation and similarity, using different corpora (from the Penn treebank) ranging in size from approximately 50000 words to 500000 words.
    The re-estimation was allowed to run for ten iterations.
    The results appear in table 2, showing the best accuracy achieved (on ambiguous words). the iteration at which it occurred, and the pattern of re-estimation (I = initial maximum
