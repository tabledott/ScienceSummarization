ained on the BLLIP corpus, whereas the sentences to be ordered were taken from news articles describing the same event.
    Not only were the news articles unseen but also their syntactic structure was unfamiliar to the model.
    The results are shown in table 5, again average pairwise i is reported.
    We also give the naive baseline of choosing a random order (BR).
    The average distance in the orderings produced by Barzilay et al.&#8217;s (2002) participants is .60.
    The distance between the humans and NL is .48 whereas the average distance between VDND and the humans is .56.
    An ANOVA yielded a significant effect of feature type (F(3,27) = 15.25; p &lt; 0.01).
    Post-hoc Tukey tests showed that VDND was significantly better than BR, but NL wasn&#8217;t.
    The difference between VDND and HH was not significant.
    Although NL performed adequately in Experiments 1 and 2, it failed to outperform the baseline in the summarization task.
    This may be due to the fact that entity-based coherence
