nce is to the middle of the text, the larger the set of sentences in the other text that are possible correspondents for it.
    The next step is to hypothesize a set of pairs of words that are assumed to correspond based on similarities between their distributions in the two texts.
    For this purpose, a word in the first text is deemed to occur at a position corresponding to a word in the second text if they occur in a pair of sentences that is a member of the AST.
    Similarity of distribution is a function of the number of corresponding sentences in which they occur and the total number of occurrences of each.
    Pairs of words are entered in the WAT if the association between them is so close that it is not likely to be the result of a random event.
    In our algorithm, the closeness of the association is estimated on the basis of the similarity of their distributions and the total number of occurrences.
    The next step is to construct the SAT, which, in the last pass, will essentially become the o
