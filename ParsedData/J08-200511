ent types of arguments labeled as A0?A5 and AA.
  These labels have different semantics for each verb and each of its senses as specified in the PropBank Frame files.
  In addition, there are also 13 types of adjuncts labeled as AM-adj where adj specifies the adjunct type.
  For simplicity in our presentation, we will also refer to these adjuncts as arguments.
  In some cases, an argument may span over different parts of a sentence; the label C-arg is then used to specify the continuity of the arguments, as shown in this example: [A1 The pearls] , [A0 I] [V said] , [C-A1 were left to my daughter-in-law].
  In some other cases, an argumentmight be a relative pronoun that in fact refers to the ac- tual agent outside the clause.
  In this case, the actual agent is labeled as the appropriate argument type, arg, while the relative pronoun is instead labeled as R-arg.
  For example, [A1 The pearls] [R-A1 which] [A0 I] [V left] [A2 to my daughter-in-law] are fake.
  Because each verb may have different senses produc
