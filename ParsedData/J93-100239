l N2 categories specified for this feature (e.g.
    N2 [CONJ EITHER], N2 [CONJ NULL] ) are generalized to the same category.
    This results in the backbone rules, when parsing either kim or lee helps, being unable, after forming a N2 [CONJ EITHER] for either kim, to discriminate between the alternatives of preparing to iterate this constituent (as in the phrase kim, lee, or sandy helps where kim would be N2 [CONJ NULL] ), or shifting the next word or to start a new constituent.
    We solve this problem by declaring CONJ to be a feature that may not have a variable value in an element of the disjoint category set.
    This directs the system to expand out each unification grammar rule that has a category containing this feature with a variable value into a number of rules fully specified for the feature, and to create backbone rules for each of these.
    There are eight possible values for CONJ in the grammar, so the general rule for forming a nominal conjunct given above, for example, ends up being repre
