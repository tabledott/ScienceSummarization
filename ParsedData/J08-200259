uation (3), ignoring the score from the local model.
    In our experiments, we noticed that for larger values of N, the performance of our re-ranking model PrSRL decreased.
    This was probably due to the fact that at test time the local classifier produces very poor argument frames near the bottom of the top n for large n. Because the re-ranking model is trained on relatively few good argument frames, it cannot easily rule out very bad frames.
    It makes sense then to incorporate the local model into our final score.
    Our final score is given by: where &#945; is a tunable parameter determining the amount of influence the local score has on the final score (we found &#945; = 1.0 to work best).
    Such interpolation with a score from a first-pass model was also used for parse re-ranking in (Collins 2000).
    Given this score, at test time we choose among the top n local assignments L1,.
