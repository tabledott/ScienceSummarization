llion Chinese characters from various domains of text such as newspapers, novels, magazines etc.
    The training corpora for class models are described in Section 5.
    Our system is designed in the way that components such as factoid detector and NER can be &#8216;switched on or off&#8217;, so that we can investigate the relative contribution of each component to the overall word segmentation performance.
    The main results are shown in Table 1.
    For comparison, we also include in the table (Row 1) the results of using the greedy segmentor (FMM) described in Section 6.
    Row 2 shows the baseline results of our system, where only the lexicon is used.
    It is interesting to find, in Rows 1 and 2, that the dictionary-based methods already achieve quite good recall, but the precisions are not very good because they cannot identify correctly unknown words that are not in the lexicon such factoids and named entities.
    We also find that even using the same lexicon, our approach that is based on the im
