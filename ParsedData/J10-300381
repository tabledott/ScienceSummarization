he start and end words of the English phrases are added.
    This indicates that phrases that start and end with the same kind of words (interrogatives or articles) are likely to be paraphrases.
    Astute readers will make the following observations about the syntactic feature nodes used by the authors: The authors extract paraphrases for a small set of input English paraphrases and show that they are able to generate a larger percentage of correct paraphrases compared to the syntactically constrained approach proposed by Callison-Burch (2008).
    They conduct no formal evaluation of the coverage of their approach but show that, in a limited setting, it is higher than that for the syntactically constrained pivot-based approach.
    However, they perform no comparisons of their coverage with the original pivot-based approach (Bannard and Callison-Burch 2005).
  
  
    Before we present some specific techniques from the literature that have been employed to evaluate paraphrase generation methods, it is impor
