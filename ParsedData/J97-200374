reas of computational linguistics.
    In particular, subsequential power series allow for efficient results in indexation of natural language texts (Crochemore 1986; Mohri 1996b).
    We briefly illustrated the application of these algorithms to speech recognition.
    More precision in acoustic modeling, finer language models, large lexicon grammars, and a larger vocabulary will lead, in the near future, to networks of much larger sizes in speech recognition.
    The determinization and minimization algorithms might help to limit the size of these networks while maintaining their time efficiency.
    These algorithms can also be used in text-to-speech synthesis.
    In fact, the same operations of composition of transducers (Sproat 1995) and perhaps more important size issues can be found in this field.
    Subsequential power series S nonbisubsequential.
  
  
    The determinization algorithm for power series can also be used to minimize transducers in many cases.
    Let us first consider the case of aut
