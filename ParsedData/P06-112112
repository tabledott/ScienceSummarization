igned item (here ?) appears only once in the rules of that derivation, as shown inFigure 2 (which satisfies the property).
			That requirement will prove to be critical when we ad dress the problem of estimating probabilities forour rules: if we allowed in our example to spuri ously generate?s in multiple successive steps of the same derivation, we would not only represent the transformation incorrectly, but also ?-rules would be disproportionately represented, leading to strongly biased estimates.
			We will now see howto ensure this constraint is satisfied in our rule ex traction and derivation building algorithm.

			The linear-time algorithm presented in GHKM is only a particular case of the more general one we describe here, which is used to extract all rules, minimal and composed, induced by G. Similarlyto the GHKM algorithm, ours performs a top down traversal of G, but differs in the operations it performs at each node n ? F : we must explore all subtrees rooted at n, find all cons
