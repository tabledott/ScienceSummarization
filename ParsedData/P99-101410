of 3 x 10 x 6 models.
    Starting from a lower bound of 50 % random choice, accuracy was calculated as the number of times the model decided for p(nlv) &gt; p(n1v1) out of all choices made.
    Fig.
    3 shows the evaluation results for models trained with 50 iterations, averaged over starting values, and plotted against class cardinality.
    Different starting values had an effect of 2 % on the performance of the test.
    We obtained a value of about 80 % accuracy for models between 25 and 100 classes.
    Models with more than 100 classes show a small but stable overfitting effect.
    A second experiment addressed the smoothing power of the model by counting the number of (v, n) pairs in the set V xN of all possible combinations of verbs and nouns which received a positive joint probability by the model.
    The V x Nspace for the above clustering models included about 425 million (v, n) combinations; we approximated the smoothing size of a model by randomly sampling 1000 pairs from V x N and returning
