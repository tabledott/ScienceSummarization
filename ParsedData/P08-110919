ively trained generative WSJ40 model (discriminative in Table 4) was trained using two of the same machines, with 16 gigabytes of RAM each for the clients.4 It took about one day per pass through the data.
    The feature-based WSJ40 model (featurebased in Table 4) was trained using four of these machines, also with 16 gigabytes of RAM each for the clients.
    It took about three days per pass through the data.
    The results clearly show that gains came from both the switch from generative to discriminative training, and from the extensive use of features.
    In Figure 3 we show for an example from section 22 the parse trees produced by our generative model and our feature-based discriminative model, and the correct parse.
    The parse from the feature-based model better exhibits the right branching tendencies of English.
    This is likely due to the heavy feature, which encourages long constituents at the end of the sentence.
    It is difficult for a standard PCFG to learn this aspect of the English l
