s (1 ) -  (3) 5y observation, looldug through text and noticing die patterns and tile rela- tionships they indicate, lu order to find new patterns automatical ly, we sketch the following procedure: 1. l)ecide on a lexical relation, R, that is of interest, e.g., "gro up/member"(iu our formulation this is a subset of the hypouylny relation).
  Gather a list of terms for which this rela- tion is known to hold, e.g., "England-country.
  This list can be found autonmtically using the method described here, bootstrapping from pat- terns found by hand, or by bootstrapping from an existing lexicon or knowledge base.
  Find places in tile corpus where these expressions occur syntactically near one another and record the environment.
  4. t,ind the commonaflties among these environ- i~leuts and hypothesize that corn.men ones yield patterns that indicate the relation of interest.
  Once a new pattern has been positively identi- fied, use it to gather more instances of the target relation and go to Step 2.
