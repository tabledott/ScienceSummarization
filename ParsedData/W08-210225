esults for the method.
    Our experiments show an improvement in performance over the results in (Collins, 2000; Charniak, 2000).
    We would argue that the Collins (2000) method is considerably more complex than ours, requiring a first-stage generative model, together with a reranking approach.
    The Charniak (2000) model is also arguably more complex, again using a carefully constructed generative model.
    The accuracy of our approach also shows some improvement over results in (Petrov and Klein, 2007).
    This work makes use of a PCFG with latent variables that is trained using a split/merge procedure together with the EM algorithm.
    This work is in many ways complementary to ours&#8212;for example, it does not make use of GLMs, dependency features, or of representations that go beyond PCFG productions&#8212;and some combination of the two methods may give further gains.
    Charniak and Johnson (2005), and Huang (2008), describe approaches that make use of nonlocal features in conjunction with t
