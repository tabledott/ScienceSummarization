ternal argument, which corresponds to the logical subject in the CLCS, has a special status and does not have the same repositioning potential that internal arguments and syntactic adjuncts have.
  In particular, the external argument has the unique property that it never participates as the incorporated argument of a conflational verb.
  Hale and Keyser (1989) provide evidence that this property holds across all languages.
  Thus, we take the external argument to have a special status (universally) that exempts it from participating in divergences other than thematic divergence.
