lso been used to measure the attributional similarity of words (Lesk 1969; Ruge 1992; Pantel and Lin 2002).
    Pantel and Lin (2002) clustered words according to their attributional similarity, as measured by a VSM.
    Their algorithm is able to discover the different senses of polysemous words, using unsupervised learning.
    Latent Semantic Analysis enhances the VSM approach to information retrieval by using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to smooth the vectors, which helps to handle noise and sparseness in the data (Deerwester et al. 1990; Dumais 1993; Landauer and Dumais 1997).
    SVD improves both document-query attributional similarity measures (Deerwester et al. 1990; Dumais 1993) and word&#8211;word attributional similarity measures (Landauer and Dumais 1997).
    LRA also uses SVD to smooth vectors, as we discuss in Section 5.
    Let R1 be the semantic relation (or set of relations) between a pair of words, A and B, and let R2 be the semantic relation (or set of relations) between another
