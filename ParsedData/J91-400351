such as those mentioned in the text, and three-dimensional, such as &amp;quot;room,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;fireplace,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pipe.&amp;quot; They are interesting semantically, because they are logically ambiguous, referring to either the object or the aperture, but not both.
    Boguraev and Pustejovsky (forthcoming) show how these logical polysemies are in fact encoded in dictionary definitions for these words. exhibits a logical polysemy involving packaging or grinding operators; e.g., haddock or lamb (cf.
    Copestake and Briscoe [1991] for details).
  
  
    In previous sections, I discussed lexical ambiguity and showed how a richer view of lexical semantics allows us to view a word's meaning as being flexible, where word senses could arise generatively by composition with other words.
    The final aspect of this flexibility deals with the logical associations a word has in a given context; that is, how this semantic information is organized as a global knowledge base.
    This involves c
