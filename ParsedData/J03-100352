raph G' = (VG,, EGI) with n vertices and at most m edges.
    We start from the graph G' = (VG, OG), where OG is the set of looping edges from the scene graph, that is, OG = UvEVG EG(v,v).
    Next we order the remaining edges from the scene graph RG = EG\OG with respect to their costs; the cheapest one comes first, the more expensive ones come later, in order of increasing expense.
    For each e E RG, we check whether G' + e is planar (e.g., using the algorithm from Hopcroft and Tarjan [1974]).
    If it is, e is added to EGI.
    The algorithm terminates when RG = 0.
    The result is a maximal planar subgraph G' of the scene graph G that differs from G only possibly in the deletion of certain relatively expensive nonlooping (relational) edges.
  
  
    We would like to thank Dennis van Oort and Denis Gerritsen for their help in the implementation and Alexander Koller and Kees van Deemter for some very useful discussions.
    Thanks are also due to Paul Piwek, Mari&#168;et Theune, Ielka van der Sluis, and
