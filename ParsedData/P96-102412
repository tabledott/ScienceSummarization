 The Inside probability is defined as e(s,t, X) = P(X Os) and the Outside probability is f(s,t, X) = P(S 3-1 X n W1 wt-1-1)&#8226; Note that while Baker and others have used these probabilites for inducing grammars, here they are used only for parsing.
    Let us define a new function, g(s,t, X).
    Now, the definition of a Labelled Recall Parse can be rewritten as Given the matrix g(s,t, X), it is a simple matter of dynamic programming to determine the parse that maximizes the Labelled Recall criterion.
    Define loop over nonterminals X let max_g:=maximum of g(s,t,X) loop over r such that s &lt;= r &lt; t let best_split:= max of maxc [s ,r] + maxc [r+1, t] maxc[s, t] := max_g + best_split; It is clear that MAXC(1, n) contains the score of the best parse according to the Labelled Recall criterion.
    This equation can be converted into the dynamic programming algorithm shown in Figure 1.
    For a grammar with r rules and k nonterminals, the run time of this algorithm is 0(n3 kn2) since there are two laye
