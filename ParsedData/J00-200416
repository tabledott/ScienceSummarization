with order information as in Equation 8.
    The most general word-to-word translation model trans(ii, V), where ii and range over sequences in Li and &#163;2, has an infinite number of parameters.
    This model can be constrained in various ways to make it more practical.
    The models presented in this article are based on the one-to-one assumption: Each word is translated to at most one other word.
    In these models, &#252; and ii may consist of at most one word each.
    As before, one of the two sequences (but not both) may be empty.
    I shall describe empty sequences as consisting of a special NULL word, so that each word sequence will contain exactly one word and can be treated as a scalar.
    Henceforth, I shall write u and v instead of &#252; and Under the one-to-one assumption, a pair of bags containing m and n nonempty words can be generated by a process where the bag size / is anywhere between max(m,n) and m + n. The one-to-one assumption is not as restrictive as it may appear: The explanat
