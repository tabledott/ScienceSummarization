al decoder weights, is where is the number of systems and is the number of similarity levels; i.e., free system weights, similarity score weights and two free interpolation weights.
    The phrasal decoder used in the phrase-level combination is based on standard beam search (Koehn, 2004).
    The decoder features are: a trigram language model score, number of target phrases, number of target words, phrase distortion, phrase distortion computed over the original translations and phrase translation confidences estimated in Section 4.1.
    The total score for a hypothesis is computed as a log-linear combination of these features.
    The feature weights and combination weights (system and similarity) may be tuned using Powell&#8217;s method on -best lists as described in Section 2.
    The phrase-level combination tuning can be summarized as follows: Testing the phrase-level combination is performed by following steps 1 through 4.
  
  
    The third combination method is based on confusion network decoding.
