gous figures for the top three participating systems for both SENSEVALs.
    The top three systems for SENSEVAL-2 are: JHU (S1) (Yarowsky et al., 2001), SMUls (S2) (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), and KUNLP (S3) (Seo et al., 2001).
    The top three systems for SENSEVAL-1 are: hopkins (s1) (Yarowsky, 2000), ets-pu (s2) (Chodorow et al., 2000), and tilburg (s3) (Veenstra et al., 2000).
    As shown in Table 4, SVM with all four knowledge sources achieves accuracy higher than the best official scores of both SENSEVALs.
    We also conducted paired t test to see if one system is significantly better than another.
    The t statistic of the difference between each pair of recall figures (between each test instance pair for micro-averaging and between each word task pair for macro-averaging) is computed, giving rise to a p value.
    A large p value indicates that the two systems are not significantly different from each other.
