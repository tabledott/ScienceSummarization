 the percentage of positively assigned pairs in the random sample.
    Fig.
    4 plots the smoothing results for the above models against the number of classes.
    Starting values had an influence of &#177; 1 % on performance.
    Given the proportion of the number of types in the training corpus to the V x N-space, without clustering we have a smoothing power of 0.14 % whereas for example a model with 50 classes and 50 iterations has a smoothing power of about 93 %.
    Corresponding to the maximum likelihood paradigm, the number of training iterations had a decreasing effect on the smoothing performance whereas the accuracy of the pseudodisambiguation was increasing in the number of iterations.
    We found a number of 50 iterations to be a good compromise in this trade-off.
  
  
    The goal of the following experiment was to derive a lexicon of several hundred intransitive and transitive verbs with subcat slots labeled with latent classes.
    To induce latent classes for the subject slot of a fixed in
