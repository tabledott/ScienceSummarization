Chinese counterpart &#8216;noun + &#20204; 4 plural noun&#8217; whereas others (e.g.
    &#21335; &#29916; &#8216;pumpkins&#8217;) cannot.
    Second, the operations required by Chinese morphological analysis such as copying in reduplication, merging and splitting, cannot be implemented using the current finite-state networks3.
    Our solution is the extended lexicalization.
    We simply collect all morphologically derived word forms of the above five types and incorporate them into the lexicon, called morph lexicon.
    The procedure involves three steps: (1) Candidate generation.
    It is done by applying a set of morphological rules to both the word lexicon and a large corpus.
    For example, the rule &#8216;noun + &#20204; 4 plural noun&#8217; would generate candidates like &#26379;&#21451;&#20204;.
    (2) Statistical filtering.
    For each candidate, we obtain a set of statistical features such as frequency, mutual information, left/right context dependency from a large corpus.
    We then use an i
