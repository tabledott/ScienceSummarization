ted here is to adapt a classical vector model based system, using WordNet synsets as indexing space instead of word forms.
    This approach combines two benefits for retrieval: one, that terms are fully disambiguated (this should improve precision); and two, that equivalent terms can be identified (this should improve recall).
    Note that query expansion does not satisfy the first condition, as the terms used to expand are words and, therefore, are in turn ambiguous.
    On the other hand, plain word sense disambiguation does not satisfy the second condition. as equivalent senses of two different words are not matched.
    Thus, indexing by synsets gets maximum matching and minimum spurious matching, seeming a good starting point to study text retrieval with WordNet.
    Given this approach, our goal is to test two main issues which are not clearly answered -to our knowledge- by the experiments mentioned above: WSD.
    This paper reports on our first results answering these questions.
