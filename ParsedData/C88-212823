ring positions in the generation process.
  This can be done by positioning all lemmas at a single position.
  Thus we need insert the lexicon only once, each word being inserted at the single position, e.g., [0, sonny ,  0].
  Although this simplifies the set of initial items, by eliminating index- ing based on string position we remove the feature of tabular parsing methods such as Earleys algorithm that makes parsing reasonably effi- cient.
  The generation behavior exhibited is therefore not goal-directed; once the lexicon is inserted many phrases might be built that could not contribute in any way to a sentence with the appropriate mean- ing.
  In order to direct the behavior of the generator towards a goal meaning, we can modify the priority function so that it is partial; not every item will be assigned a priority and those that are not will never be added to the table (or agenda) at all.
  The filter we have been using assigns priorities only to items that might contribute semantically to the goal mea
