 increasing this value had no effect on accuracy or convergence and was detrimental to speed; for SGD, the learning rate parameter was tuned manually.
    Note that we have not spent much time optimizing the values of p1 and p2.
    Based on a pilot study on Nettalk, we found that taking p1 = .5 and p2 in the order of 10&#8722;5 to yield nearly optimal performance, and have used these values throughout.
    Our first benchmark is the word phonetization task, using the Nettalk dictionary (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987).
    This dataset contains approximately 20,000 English word forms, their pronunciation, plus some prosodic information (stress markers for vowels, syllabic parsing for consonants).
    Grapheme and phoneme strings are aligned at the character level, thanks to the use of a &#8220;null sound&#8221; in the latter string when it is shorter than the former; likewise, each prosodic mark is aligned with the corresponding letter.
    We have derived two test conditions from this database.
    The first
