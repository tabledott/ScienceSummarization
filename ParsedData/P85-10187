 if we find a verb that subcategorizes for a noun phrase, but the grammar rules allow postverbal NPs, PPs, s, VPs, and so forth, the parser will have no way to eliminate the building of edges corresponding to these categories.
    Only when such edges attempt to join with the V will the inconsistency be found.
    Similarly, if information about filler-gap dependencies is kept extrinsic to the category information, as in a slash category in GPSG or an LFG annotation concerning a matching constituent for a it specification, there will be no way to keep from hypothesizing gaps at any given vertex.
    This &amp;quot;gap-proliferation&amp;quot; problem has plagued many attempts at building parsers for grammar formalisms in this style.
    In fact, by making these stringent requirements on what information is used to guide parsing, we have to a certain extent thrown the baby out with the bathwater.
    These formalisms were intended to free us from the tyranny of atomic nonterminal symbols, but for good performan
