record whether an entity is present (x) or absent (&#8211;) in a sentence.
    We employ a robust statistical parser (Collins 1997) to determine the constituent structure for each sentence, from which subjects (s), objects (o), and relations other than subject or object (x) are identified.
    The phrase-structure output of Collins&#8217;s parser is transformed into a dependency tree from which grammatical relations are extracted.
    Passive verbs are recognized using a small set of patterns, and the underlying deep grammatical role for arguments involved in the passive construction is entered in the grid (see the grid cell o for Microsoft, Sentence 2, Table 2).
    For more details on the grammatical relations extraction component we refer the interested reader to Barzilay (2003).
    Salience.
    Centering and other discourse theories conjecture that the way an entity is introduced and mentioned depends on its global role in a given discourse.
    We evaluate the impact of salience information by consider
