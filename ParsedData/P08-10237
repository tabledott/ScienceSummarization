e parse tree for the preposition case is shown in Figure 2(b) as the 1-best parse, while for the conjunction case, the two proper nouns (B`ushiand Sh&#175;al&#180;ong) are combined to form a coordinated NP which functions as the subject of the sentence.
    In this case the Chinese sentence is translated into Shown in Figure 3(a), these two parse trees can be represented as a single forest by sharing common subtrees such as NPB0,1 and VPB3,6.
    Such a forest has a structure of a hypergraph (Klein and Manning, 2001; Huang and Chiang, 2005), where items like NP0,3 are called nodes, and deductive steps like (*) correspond to hyperedges.
    More formally, a forest is a pair (V, E), where V is the set of nodes, and E the set of hyperedges.
    For a given sentence w1:l = w1 ... wl, each node v E V is in the form of Xi,j, which denotes the recognition of nonterminal X spanning the substring from positions i through j (that is, wi+1 ... wj).
    Each hyperedge e E E is a pair (tails(e), head(e)), where head(e) E
