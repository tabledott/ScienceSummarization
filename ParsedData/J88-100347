lly) overwhelming effect of an article on disambiguating an immediately following noun/verb ambiguity.
    At this point, only the optimal path to each of the tags for &amp;quot;still&amp;quot; is saved.
    We then go on to match each of those paths with each of the tags for &amp;quot;saw&amp;quot;, discovering the optimal paths to saw-NN and to saw-VB.
    The next iteration reveals the optimal paths to her-PPO and her-PP$, and the final one picks the optimal path to the period, which this example treats as unambiguous.
    Now we have the best path between two certain tags (AT and .
    ), and can merely pop the stack, following pointers to optimal predecessors to disambiguate the sequence.
    The period becomes the start of the next span.
    Initial testing of the algorithm used only transitional probability information.
    RTPs had no effect upon choosing an optimal path.
    For example, in deciding whether to consider the word &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; to be a noun or a verb, environments such as a p
