ithms as a function of the number of features, n. For example, if Savings(100) = 1,200, this signifies that for the first 100 rounds of feature selection, the improved algorithm is 1,200 times as efficient as the naive algorithm.
    Finally, Savings(a, b) indicates the relative efficiency between rounds a and b, inclusive, of feature selection.
    For example, Savings(11, 100) = 83 signifies that between rounds 11 and 100 inclusive of the algorithm, the improved algorithm was 83 times as efficient.
    Figures 8 and 9 show graphs of Work(n) and Savings(n) versus n. The savings from the improved algorithm are dramatic.
    In 100,000 rounds of feature selection, the improved algorithm requires total computation that is equivalent to a mere 37.1 passes over the training set.
    This is a saving of a factor of 2,692 over the naive algorithm.
    Table 4 shows the value of Savings(a,b) for various values of (a,b).
    It can be seen that the performance gains are significantly larger in later rounds of feature
