cal sentence c E C, which is a subsequence of f. Similarly to K&amp;M and many successful syntactic parsers (Collins, 1999; Klein and Manning, 2003), our sentence compression system is generative, and attempts to find the optimal compression c&#65533; by estimating the following function:1 If &#964;(f, c) is the set of all tree pairs that yield (f, c) according to some underlying SCFG, we can estimate the probability of the sentence pair using: We note that, in practice (and as in K&amp;M), Equation 2 is often approximated by restricting &#964;(f, c) to a unique full tree orf, the best hypothesis of an off-the-shelf syntactic parser.
    This implies that each possible compression c is the target-side yield of at most one SCFG derivation.
    As in standard PCFG history-based models, the probability of the entire structure (Equation 2) is factored into probabilities of grammar productions.
