 similarly problematic.
    I have devised a method for determining the number of boundaries to assign that scales with the size of the document and is sensitive to the patterns of similarity scores that it produces: the cutoff is a function of the average and standard deviations of the depth scores for the text under analysis.
    Currently a boundary is drawn only if the depth score exceeds g &#8212; a/2.
  
  
    One way to evaluate these segmentation algorithms is to compare against judgments made by human readers, another is to compare the algorithms against texts premarked by authors, and a third way is to see how well the results improve a computational task.
    This section compares the algorithm against reader judgments, since author markups are fallible and are usually applied to text types that this algorithm is not designed for, and Hearst (1994) shows how to use TextTiles in a task (although it does not show whether or not the results of the algorithms used here are better than some other algor
