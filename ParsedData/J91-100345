 (1984) criticizes the idea that literal and nonliteral meaning can be discriminated in ordered processing stages.
    My response is that if the met* method is viewed in parallel processing terms then literal, metonymic, metaphorical, and anomalous interpretations are all sought at the same time and there is no ordering such that the literal meaning of a sentence is computed first and then an alternative meaning sought if the literal meaning is defective.
    Gibbs' other main criticism, concerning the traditional analysis of sentence meaning as composed from word meanings and independent of context, will be discussed in Section 7.
