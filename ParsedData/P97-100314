    We use the PARSEVAL measures (Black et al. 91) to compare performance: number of correct constituents in proposed parse number of constituents in proposed parse number of correct constituents in proposed parse number of constituents in treebank parse Crossing Brackets = number of constituents which violate constituent boundaries with a constituent in the treebank parse.
    For a constituent to be 'correct' it must span the same set of words (ignoring punctuation, i.e. all tokens tagged as commas, colons or quotes) and have the same label' as a constituent in the treebank parse.
    Table 2 shows the results for Models 1, 2 and 3.
    The precision/recall of the traces found by Model 3 was 93.3%/90.1% (out of 436 cases in section 23 of the treebank), where three criteria must be met for a trace to be &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot;: (1) it must be an argument to the correct head-word; (2) it must be in the correct position in relation to that head word (preceding or followi
