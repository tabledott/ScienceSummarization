babilities comparable to the mixture alignment model.
			When looking at the position alignments those generated by the ItMM model are in general much smoother.
			This could be especially helpful for languages uch as German, where compound words are matched to several words in the source language.
			On the oth- er hand, large jumps due to different word order- ings in the two languages are successfully modeled.
			We are presently studying and testing a nmltilevel HMM model that allows only a small number of large jumps.
			The ultimate test of the different alignment and translation models can only be car- ried out in the framework of a fully operational translation system.
