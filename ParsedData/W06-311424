nd rich target language morphology are two reasons for this.
    Again, we can compute average scores for all systems for the different language pairs (Figure 6).
    The differences in difficulty are better reflected in the BLEU scores than in the raw un-normalized manual judgements.
    The easiest language pair according to BLEU (English-French: 28.33) received worse manual scores than the hardest (English-German: 14.01).
    This is because different judges focused on different language pairs.
    Hence, the different averages of manual scores for the different language pairs reflect the behaviour of the judges, not the quality of the systems on different language pairs.
    Given the closeness of most systems and the wide over-lapping confidence intervals it is hard to make strong statements about the correlation between human judgements and automatic scoring methods such as BLEU.
    We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al. (2006) that the rule-based system of Systran is not adequately appreciate
