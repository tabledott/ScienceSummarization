  A Probabilistic Approach to Syntax-based Reordering for Statistical Machine Translation
  
    chl, dozhang@microsoft.com mhli@insun.hit.edu.cn muli, mingzhou@microsoft.com guanyi@insun.hit.edu.cn Abstract Inspired by previous preprocessing approaches to SMT, this paper proposes a novel, probabilistic approach to reordering which combines the merits of syntax and phrase-based SMT.
    Given a source sentence and its parse tree, our method generates, tree operations, an list of reordered inputs, which are then fed to standard phrase-based decoder to produce the optimal translation.
    Experiments show that, for the NIST MT-05 task of Chinese-to- English translation, the proposal leads to BLEU improvement of 1.56%.
  
  
    The phrase-based approach has been considered the default strategy to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) in recent years.
    It is widely known that the phrase-based approach is powerful in local lexical choice and word reordering within short distance.
    However, long-distance re
