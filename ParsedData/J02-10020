  A Critique And Improvement Of An Evaluation Metric For Text Segmentation
  
    metric, initially proposed by Beeferman, Berger, and Lafferty (1997), is becoming the standard measure for assessing text segmentation algorithms.
    However, a theoretical analysis of the metric finds several problems: the metric penalizes false negatives more heavily than false positives, overpenalizes near misses, and is affected by variation in segment size dis- We propose a simple modification to the that remedies these problems.
    This new metric&#8212;called WindowDiff&#8212;moves a fixed-sized window across the text and penalizes the algorithm whenever the number of boundaries within the window does not match the true number of boundaries for that window of text.
