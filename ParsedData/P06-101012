    Formally, suppose the current generation of transliteration scores are (ei, ci, wi) i = 1, ..., n, where (ei, ci) is a distinct pair of English and Chinese names.
    Note that although for any i =6 j, we have (ei, ci) =6 (ej, cj), it is possible that ei = ej or ci = cj for some i =6 j. wi is the transliteration score of (ei, ci).
    These pairs along with their co-occurrence relation computed based on our comparable corpora can be formally represented by a graph as shown in Figure 2.
    In such a graph, a node represents (ei, ci, wi).
    An edge between (ei, ci, wi) and (ej, cj, wj) is constructed iff (ei, ci) and (ej, cj) co-occur in a certain document pair (Et, Ct), i.e. there exists a document pair (Et, Ct), such that ei, ej &#8712; Et and ci, cj &#8712; Ct.
    Given a node (ei, ci, wi), we refer to all its directly-connected nodes as its &#8220;neighbors&#8221;.
    The documents do not appear explicitly in the graph, but they implicitly affect the graph&#8217;s topology and the weight of each ed
