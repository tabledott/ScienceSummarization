 into a default class Entity, as in T3.
    E1 then represents the event defined by the three entities, as defined in Table 1.
    Note that for Task 1, the entity, T3, does not need to be identified, and the event, E1, may be identified without specification of the secondary argument, ToLoc:T1: Finding the full representation of E1 is the goal of Task 2.
    In the example, the localization event, E1, is negated as expressed in the failure of.
    Finding the negation, M1 is the goal of Task 3.
  
  
    The data sets are prepared in two collections: the abstract and the full text collections.
    The abstract collection includes the same data used for BioNLPST 2009, and is meant to be used to measure the progress of the community.
    The full text collection includes full papers which are newly annotated, and is meant to be used to measure the generalization of the technology to full papers.
    Table 2 shows the statistics of the annotations in the GE task data sets.
    Since the training data from the f
