efinite description resolution (e.g., Sidner 1979; Carter 1987; Alshawi 1990; Poesio 1993).
    Too many facts and axioms would have to be encoded by hand for theories of this type to be tested even on a medium-sized corpus.
    Our system, therefore, is based on a shallow-processing approach more radical even than that attempted by the first advocate of this approach, Carter (1987), or by the systems that participated in the MUC evaluations (Appelt et al. 1995; Gaizaukas et al.
    1995; Humphreys et al. 1988), since we made no attempt to fine-tune the system to maximize performance on a particular domain.
    The system relies only on structural information, on the information provided by preexisting lexical sources such as WordNet (Fellbatun 1998), on minimal amounts of general hand-coded information, or on information that could be acquired automatically from a corpus.
    As a result, the system does not really have the resources to correctly resolve those definite descriptions whose interpretation does
