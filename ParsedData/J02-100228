pears completely.
    The results for the FNP segmentation are consistent with what one would expect of a mix of the FN and FP segmentations.
    Several other observations can be made from Table 1.
    We can begin to make some judgments about how the metric performs on algorithms prone to different kinds of errors.
    First, Pk penalizes false negatives about twice as much as false positives, as predicted by our analysis.
    The experimental segmentations in Table 1a contain on average 500 false negatives, while the ones in Table 1b contain on average 500 false positives, but the penalty for the Table 1b segmentations is consistently about half that for those in Table 1a.
    Thus, algorithms prone to false positives are penalized less harshly than those prone to false negatives.
    The table also shows the performance of the two other metrics.
    Pk simply doubles the false positive penalty, while WD counts and compares the number of boundaries between the two ends of the probe, as described earlier.
