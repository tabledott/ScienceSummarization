t follows that only events that are contingently related necessarily have well-defined temporal relations in memory.
    A first attempt to investigate this kind of system was reported in Steedman 1982, using a program that verified queries against a database structured according to some of the principles outlined above; a more recent extension of this work was reported in Moens 1987.
    Events are stored as primitives in the database, possibly but not necessarily associated with a time point.
    Extended events are represented in terms of a pair of punctual events, identifying their starting point as well as the point at which they end (in the case of processes) or culminate (in the case of culminated processes).
    Apart from the obvious accessibility relations of temporal precedence and simultaneity, events can also enter into the relation of contingency introduced above.
    It is significant that the relation used in the implementation is identical to the notion of causality used by Lansky 1986 in an
