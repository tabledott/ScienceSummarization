aphrases.
    Discriminative training was conducted on 1,820 sentences; final evaluation on 2,390 sentences.
    A baseline paraphrase table consisting of 33 million English para-phrase pairs was extracted from 1 billion phrase pairs from three different languages, at a cutoff of para-phrase probabilities of 0.0025.
    Query expansion is done by adding terms introduced in n-best paraphrases of the query.
    Table 2 shows example paraphrases for the query &#8220;how to live with cat allergies&#8221; with newly introduced terms highlighted in bold face.
  
  
    Our baseline answer retrieval system is modeled after the tfidf retrieval model of Jijkoun and de Rijke (2005).

    We used the cosine similarity metric with logarithmically weighted term and document frequency weights in order to reproduce the Lucene3 model used in Jijkoun and de Rijke (2005).
