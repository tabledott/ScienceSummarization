stinct chunk representations and different machine learning algorithms, such as MBL, ME and IGTree(Tjong Kim Sang, 2000a; Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2000).
    It is well-known that weighted voting scheme has a potential to maximize the margin between critical samples and the separating hyperplane, and produces a decision function with high generalization performance(Schapire et al., 1997).
    The boosting technique is a type of weighted voting scheme, and has been applied to many NLP problems such as parsing, part-of-speech tagging and text categorization.
    In our experiments, in order to obtain higher accuracy, we also apply weighted voting of 8 SVMbased systems which are trained using distinct chunk representations.
    Before applying weighted voting method, first we need to decide the weights to be given to individual systems.
    We can obtain the best weights if we could obtain the accuracy for the &#8220;true&#8221; test data.
    However, it is impossible to estimate them.
    In boosting technique,
