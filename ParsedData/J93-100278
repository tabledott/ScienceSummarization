PP(inf) = 8 (Sharman 1991).
    25 words in length.)
    There are 22 definitions one word in length: all of these trivially receive correct analyses.
    There are 89 definitions between two and ten words in length inclusive (mean length 6.2).
    Of these, in 68 cases the correct analysis (as defined by the training corpus) is also the most highly ranked.
    In 13 of the 21 remaining cases the correct analysis is the second or third most highly ranked analysis.
    Looking at these 21 cases in more detail, in 8 there is an inappropriate structural preference for 'low' or 'local' attachment (see Kimball 1973), in 4, an inappropriate preference for compounds, and in 6 of the remaining 9 cases, the highest ranked result contains a misanalysis of a single constituent two or three words in length.
    If these results are interpreted in terms of a goodness of fit measure such as that of Sampson, Haigh, and Atwell (1989), the measure would be better than 96%.
    If we take correct parse/sentence as our measure
