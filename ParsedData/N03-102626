em output against any number of independent human-written condensations of the same original sentence.
    This idea of computing matching scores to multiple reference examples was proposed by Alshawi et al. (1998), and later by Papineni et al.
    (2001) for evaluation of machine translation systems.
    Similar to these proposals, an evaluation of condensation quality could consider multiple reference condensations and record the matching score against the most similar example.
    Another desideratum for future work is to carry condensation all the way through without unpacking at any stage.
    Work on employing packing techniques not only for parsing and transfer, but also for generation and stochastic selection is currently underway (see Geman and Johnson (2002)).
    This will eventually lead to a system whose components work on packed representations of all or n-best solutions, but completely avoid costly unpacking of representations.
