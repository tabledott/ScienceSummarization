c resources which can judge practically every induced n-gram.
    With permission and sufficient time, one can repeatedly query websites that host large collections of MRDs and evaluate each n-gram.
    Having approval, we queried: (1) onelook.com, (2) acronymfinder.com, and (3) infoplease.com.
    The first website interfaces with over 600 electronic dictionaries.
    The second is devoted to identifying proper acronyms.
    The third focuses on world facts such as historical figures and organization names.
    To minimize disruption to websites by reducing the total number of queries needed for evaluation, we use an evaluation approach from the information retrieval community (Sparck-Jones and van Rijsbergen, 1975).
    Each algorithm reports its top 5000 MWU choices and the union of these choices (45192 possible n-grams) is looked up on the Internet.
    Valid MWUs identified at any website are assumed to be the only valid units in the data. i, the frequency-like approaches are independent of Algorithms ar
