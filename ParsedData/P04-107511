maximize the accumulated similarity degree between the sequences.
    Here, we adapt it to our task.
    A sketch of the modified algorithm is as follows.
    Let NE1 = w11w12...w1n...w1N, (n = 1,..., N) and NE2 = w21w22...w2m...w2M, (m = 1,..., M) denote two word sequences to be matched.
    NE1 and NE2 consist of M and N words respectively.
    NE1(n) = w1n and NE2(m) = w2m.
    A similarity value Sim(w1n ,w2m) has been known for every pair of words (w1n,w2m) within NE1 and NE2.
    The goal of DTW is to find a path, m = map(n), which map n onto the corresponding m such that the accumulated similarity Sim* along the path is maximized. map n n= A dynamic programming method is used to determine the optimum path map(n).
    The accumulated similarity SimA to any grid point (n, m) can be recursively calculated as Certainly, the overall similarity measure Sim* has to be normalized as longer sequences normally give higher similarity value.
    So, the similarity between two sequences NE1 and NE2 is calculated as
