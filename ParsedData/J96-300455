ew words (30% of those found by the automatic segmenter) on which all judges agreed, whereas most of the words found by the segmenter were such that one human judge agreed.
    Proper-Name Identification.
    To evaluate proper-name identification, we randomly selected 186 sentences containing 12,000 hanzi from our test corpus and segmented the text automatically, tagging personal names; note that for names, there is always a single unambiguous answer, unlike the more general question of which segmentation is correct.
    The performance was 80.99% recall and 61.83% precision.
    Interestingly, Chang et al. report 80.67% recall and 91.87% precision on an 11,000 word corpus: seemingly, our system finds as many names as their system, but with four times as many false hits.
    However, we have reason to doubt Chang et al. 's performance claims.
    Without using the same test corpus, direct comparison is obviously difficult; fortunately, Chang et al. include a list of about 60 sentence fragments that exemplify
