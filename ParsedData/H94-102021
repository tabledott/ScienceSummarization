to be recovered in most cases when the full parallel struc- ture is within the same clause.
  In essence, we use the com- plete clause as a template and provide a notation to allow arguments to be mapped from the gapped clause onto that template.
  In the template notation, we use an equal sign to indicate that constituent NP=I  should be mapped over NP-1 in the largest conjoined structure that NP-1 and NP=I  both occur in.
  A variety of simple notational devices, which we will not discuss here, extend this notation to handle constituents that occur in one branch of the conjunct, but not the other.
