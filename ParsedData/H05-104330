			OPINE?s precision is higher than that of PMI++ and Hu++.
			All results are reported with respect to PMI++ . Notation: adj=adjectives, nn=nouns, vb=verbs, adv=adverbs 3.4.1 Experiments: SO LabelsOn the task of finding SO labels for words in the con text of given features and review sentences, OPINE obtains higher precision than both baseline methods at a smallloss in recall with respect to PMI++.
			As described be low, this result is due in large part to OPINE?s ability to handle context-sensitive opinion words.
			We randomly selected 200 (word, feature, sentence) tuples for each word type (adjective, adverb, etc.) andobtained a test set containing 800 tuples.
			Two annota tors assigned positive, negative and neutral labels to eachtuple (the inter-annotator agreement was 78%).
