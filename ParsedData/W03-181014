e movement as Baldwin and Villavicencio do.
    This would be a good way to improve phrasal extraction accuracy, particularly where a particle follows a pronoun.
  
  
    In our experiments we asked human judges to rank phrasal verb candidates as to how compositional they are.
    From the full set of 4272 phrasal verb candidate types output from the RASP parser we obtained 100 candidates randomly subject to the constraint that 33 3 each came from one of 3 frequency ranges (each range covering an even number of phrasal types) from 20 to the maximum frequency.
    A further 16 manually selected phrasals were added to this test set.
    Three native English speakers ranked the 116 candidates on a numerical score 0 to 10 (10 for fullycompositional, 0 for totally opaque), or gave a &amp;quot;don't know&amp;quot; response.
    We discounted any item where any of the judges had put such a &amp;quot;don't know&amp;quot;.
    This only removed a total of 5 items, leaving a ranking from all 3 judges on 111 candidates
