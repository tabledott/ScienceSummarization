    Mentions have three levels: names, nomial expressions or pronouns.
    The RDC task detects and classifies implicit and explicit relations1 between entities identified by the EDT task.

    Extraction of semantic relationships between entities can be very useful for applications such as question answering, e.g. to answer the query &#8220;Who is the president of the United States?&#8221;.
    This paper focuses on the ACE RDC task and employs diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
    Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information contributes to most of the per
