since it gives much worse performance.
    This finding is consistent with previous work (Ravichandran et al., 2003) that compares maximum entropy classification and re-ranking on a question answering task.
    We will now describe the features used to train the maximum entropy model mentioned previously.
    To rank all speakers (aside from the B speaker) and to determine how likely each one is to be the A speaker of the adjacency pair involving speaker B, we use four categories of features: structural, durational, lexical, and dialog act (DA) information.
    For the remainder of this section, we will interchangeably use A to designate either the potential A speaker or the most recent utterance4 of that speaker, assuming the distinction is generally unambiguous.
    We use B to designate either the B speaker or the current spurt for which we need to identify a corresponding A part.
    The feature sets are listed in Table 1.
    Structural features encode some helpful information regarding ordering and over
