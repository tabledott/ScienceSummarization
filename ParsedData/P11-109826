  For instance, a perpetrator of a bombing and a perpetrator of an attack are treated the same.
    This allows supervised classifiers to train on all perpetrators at once, rather than template-specific learners.
    Although not ideal for our learning goals, we report it for comparison against previous work.
    Several supervised approaches have presented results on MUC-4, but unfortunately we cannot compare against them.
    Maslennikov and Chua (2006; 2007) evaluated a random subset of test (they report .60 and .63 F1), and Xiao et al. (2004) did not evaluate all slot types (they report .57 F1).
    Figure 5 thus shows our results with previous work that is comparable: the fully supervised and weakly supervised approaches of Patwardhan and Riloff (2009; 2007).
    We give two numbers for our system: mapping one learned template to Attack, and mapping five.
    Our learned templates for Attack have a different granularity than MUC-4.
    Rather than one broad Attack type, we learn several: Shooting, Murder
