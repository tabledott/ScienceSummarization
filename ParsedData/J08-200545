m does not have enough in- formation for the pruning heuristics, we train two word-based classifiers to replace the pruning stage.
  One classifier is trained to predict whether a given word is the start (S) of 2 The value was determined by experimenting with the complete system using automatic full parse trees, on the development set.
  In our tests, lowering the threshold in argument identification always leads to higher overall recall and lower overall precision.
  As a result, the gain in F1 is limited.
