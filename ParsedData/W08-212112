ed by the Linguistic Data Consortium, with the exception of NomBank, which is freely downloadable.6 The Penn Treebank 3 corpus (Marcus et al., 1993) consists of hand-coded parses of the Wall Street Journal (test, development and training) and a small subset of the Brown corpus (W. N. Francis and H. Ku&#710;cera, 1964) (test only).
    These hand parses are notated in-line and sometimes involve changing the strings of the input data.
    For example, in file wsj 0309, the token fearlast in the text corresponds to the two tokens fear and last in the annotated data.
    In a similar way, cannot is regularly split to can and not.
    It is significant that the other annotations assume the tokenization of the Penn Treebank, as this makes it easier for us to merge the annotation.
    The Penn Treebank syntactic annotation includes phrases, parts of speech, empty category representations of various filler/gap constructions and other phenomena, based on a theoretical perspective similar to that of Government and Bind
