Recently there has been a growing amount of research on automatic paraphrase discovery.
    For example, (Barzilay 01) proposed a method to extract paraphrases from parallel translations derived from one original document.
    We proposed to find paraphrases from multiple newspapers reporting the same event, using shared Named Entities to align the phrases (Shinyama et al. 02).
    We also proposed a method to find paraphrases in the context of two Named Entity instances in a large un-annotated corpus (Sekine 05).
    The phrases connecting two NEs are grouped based on two types of evidence.
    One is the identity of the NE instance pairs, as multiple instances of the same NE pair (e.g.
    Yahoo! and Overture) are likely to refer to the same relationship (e.g. acquisition).
    The other type of evidence is the keywords in the phrase.
    If we gather a lot of phrases connecting NE's of the same two NE types (e.g. company and company), we can cluster these phrases and find some typical expressions (e.g. mer
