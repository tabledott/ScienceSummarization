ations, there are only a small number of ways syntactic entities may be repositioned.
  The three CLCS positions that are involved in these relations are X, Z ~, and Q.
  If we compute the repositionings combinatorically, there are 33 = 27 configurations (i.e., X ~, Z, and Q~ would map into any of three positions).
  However, we can eliminate 15 of these (since a CLCS must contain exactly one head), thus leaving only 12 possible configurations.
  One of these corresponds to the default G?~ mapping (i.e., the logical head, logical argument, and logical modifier map into canonical positions).
  The remaining 11 configurations can be factored into three cases as follows: 1.
  X 4=&gt; X 1.1 Q ~ Z; Z 1 4=~ Z.
  1.2 Z ~ Q; Q 4=~ Q.
  1.3 Q &lt;~ Z; Z ~ Q.
  X 2.1 X ~ 4=~ Z; Z ??
  2.2 X ~Z;Z  ~&lt;=~Q.
  23 We have left out the possibility of an external argument as a participant in the head-satellite r lation.
  Of course, the external argument is a satellite with respect to the head, but it turns out that the ex
