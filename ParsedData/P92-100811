on a 2,200-sentence subset of the full 10,718sentence corpus.
    Since this subset excluded the unanswerable sentences, Gemini's coverage on the full corpus is only an estimated 70% for syntax, and 50% for semantics.2 In the first experiment, based on parsing complete sentences, Gemini was tested on a subset of the data that the pattern matcher returned as likely to contain a repair.
    We excluded all sentences that contained fragments, resulting in a 2Gemini's syntactic coverage of the 2,200-sentence dataset it was trained on (the set of annotated and answerable MADCOW queries) is approximately 91%, while its semantic coverage is approximately 77%.
    On a recent fair test, Gemini's syntactic coverage was 87% and semantic coverage was 71%. dataset of 335 sentences, of which 179 contained repairs and 176 contained false positives.
    The approach was as follows: for each sentence, parsing was attempted.
    If parsing succeeded, the sentence was marked as a false positive.
    If parsing did not succeed,
