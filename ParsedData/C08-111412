: An example of a question from the 374 SAT analogy questions.
			The problem of recognizing word analogies wasfirst attempted with a system called Argus (Reit 4http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/.
			907man, 1965), using a small hand-built semantic network with a spreading activation algorithm.
			Turney et al (2003) used a combination of 13 independent modules.
			Veale (2004) used a spread ing activation algorithm with WordNet (in effect, treating WordNet as a semantic network).
			Turney (2006) used a corpus-based algorithm.We may view Table 2 as a binary classification problem, in which mason:stone and carpen ter:wood are positive examples and the remaining word pairs are negative examples.
			The difficulty is that the labels of the choice pairs must be hidden from the learning algorithm.
			That is, the training set consists of one positive example (the stem pair)and the testing set consists of five unlabeled exam ples (the five choice pairs).
			To make this task more tractable, we randomly choose a
