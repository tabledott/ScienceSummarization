  Selectional Preference And Sense Disambiguation
  
    absence of is a real problem for corpus-based approaches to sense disambiguation, one that is unlikely to be solved soon.
    Selectional preference is traditionally connected with sense ambiguity; this paper explores how a statistical model of selectional preference, requiring neither manual annotation of selection restrictions nor supervised training, can be used in sense disambiguation.
  
  
    It has long been observed that selectional constraints and word sense disambiguation are closely linked.
    Indeed, the exemplar for sense disambiguation in most computational settings (e.g., see Allen's (1995) discussion) is Katz and Fodor's (1964) use of Boolean selection restrictions to constrain semantic interpretation.
    For example, although burgundy can be interpreted as either a color or a beverage, only the latter sense is available in the context of Mary drank burgundy, because the verb drink specifies the selection restriction +LIQUID for its
