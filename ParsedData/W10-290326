ctive function using the CuttingPlane method, this allows us to parrallelize the learning process by solving the inference problem for multiple training examples simultaneously.
  
  
    Our experiments are designed to answer three questions: We first compare how well our model performs under four different learning regimes.
    NOLEARN uses a manually initialized weight vector.
    DIRECT and AGGRESSIVE use the two response driven learning approaches, where a feedback function but no logical forms are provided.
    As an upper bound we train the model using a fully SUPERVISED approach where the input sentences are paired with hand annotated logical forms.
    Table 1 shows the accuracy of each setup.
    The model without learning (NOLEARN) gives a starting point with an accuracy of 22.2%.
    The response driven learning methods perform substantially better than the starting point.
    The DIRECT approach which uses a binary learner reaches an accuracy of 75.2% on the R250 data and 69.2% on the Q250 (testi
