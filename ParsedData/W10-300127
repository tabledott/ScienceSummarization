-nearest neighbour (KNN); The way of identifying scopes: predicting first/last tokens (FL), first/inside/last tokens (FIL), just inside tokens (I); Multiple Hedges: the system applied a mechanism for handling multiple hedges inside a sentence and token classification (TC) approaches (see Table 7).
    The feature sets used here are the same as for Task1, extended by several features describing the relationship between the cue phrase and the token in question mostly by describing the dependency path between them.
  
  
    The CoNLL-2010 Shared Task introduced the novel task of uncertainty detection.
    The challenge consisted of a sentence identification task on uncertainty (Task1) and an in-sentence hedge scope detection task (Task2).
    In the latter task the goal of automatic systems was to recognize speculative text spans inside sentences.
    The relatively high number of participants indicates that the problem is rather interesting for the Natural Language Processing community.
    We think that this
