l information is helpful in augmenting existing electronic dictionaries, (cf.
    Church and Hanks [1989]), and we have used lists of character pairs ranked by mutual information to expand our own dictionary.
    Nonstochastic lexical-knowledge-based approaches have been much more numerous.
    Two issues distinguish the various proposals.
    The first concerns how to deal with ambiguities in segmentation.
    The second concerns the methods used (if any) to extend the lexicon beyond the static list of entries provided by the machine-readable dictionary upon which it is based.
    The most popular approach to dealing with segmentation ambiguities is the maximum matching method, possibly augmented with further heuristics.
    This method, one instance of which we term the &amp;quot;greedy algorithm&amp;quot; in our evaluation of our own system in Section 5, involves starting at the beginning (or end) of the sentence, finding the longest word starting (ending) at that point, and then repeating the process star
