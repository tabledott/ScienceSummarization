formed by computational models of dialogue, the categories themselves are more independent of the task than schemes devised with particular machine dialogue types in mind.
    Second, although other coding schemes may distinguish many categories for utterances segmented according to the discourse goals they serve, by showing game and transaction structures this coding scheme attempts to classify dialogue structure at higher levels as well.
    Finally, although the other coding schemes appear to have been devised primarily with one purpose in mind, this coding scheme is intended to represent dialogue structure generically so that it can be used in conjunction with codings of many other dialogue phenomena.
  
  
    The coding distinguishes three levels of dialogue structure, similar to the three middle levels in Sinclair and Coulthard's (1975) analysis of classroom discourse.
    At the highest level, dialogues are divided into transactions, which are subdialogues that accomplish one major step in the partici
