rained in those studies), but they nonetheless indicate consistent agreement.
    Interestingly, when the agreement is conducted cross-lingually between an English and a Romanian annotator, the agreement figures, although somewhat lower, are comparable.
    In fact, once the Uncertain tags are removed, the monolingual and cross-lingual agreement and K values become almost equal, which suggests that in most cases the sentence-level subjectivity is preserved.
    The disagreements were reconciled first between the labels assigned by the two Romanian annotators, followed by a reconciliation between the resulting Romanian &#8220;gold-standard&#8221; labels and the labels assigned by the English annotator.
    In most cases, the disagreement across the two languages was found to be due to a difference of opinion about the sentence subjectivity, similar to the differences encountered in monolingual annotations.
    However, there are cases where the differences are due to the subjectivity being lost in the translat
