nt analogy.
    Figure 19 shows this match of the relevant cell as a vector statement.
    Let us compare the two pairs of matched relevant cells for (27): [[animall, drink1, drinkl], [carl, use2, gasolinel ]] [[animall, drinkl, drinkl], [human_beingl, drinkl, coffeel]] The two source cells are the same but the two target cells, [carl, use2, gasoline]] and [human_being1, drinkl, coffeel], are very different.
    The reason that the sentence as a whole is metaphorical/anomalous is because of the clash between these target cells.
    The basic analogy of a car ingesting a liquid does not carry over from the first semantic dependency into the second.
    The anomalous flavor of (27) could not be detected by looking at the semantic relations in the dependencies in isolation because one semantic relation is metaphorical and the other is literal.
    Neither relation is anomalous &#8212; the anomaly comes from the interaction between the two relations.
    Figure 20 is a proposed representation for sentence (20).
