    This is a very important point that will allow us to filter out many invalid collocations and also produce more functional information at stages 2 and 3.
    A graphical interpretation of the filtering method used for Xtract is given in Smadja (1991).

    Xtract Stage Two: From 2-Grams to N-Grams The role of the second stage of Xtract is twofold.
    It produces collocations involving more than two words, and it filters
