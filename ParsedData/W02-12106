bligatory, but must also be realized adjacent to the selecting head.
    To account for this, our subcategorization contains the attributes SAT and VAL.
    The SAT value encodes whether a verbal argument is already saturated (such that it cannot be saturated again), optional or adjacent.
    VAL contains the agreement information for the argument.
    When an argument is realized, its SAT value on the mother node is specified as sat and its SYNSEM is unified with its VAL value on the subcategorizing head.
    The VAL value on the mother is none.
    Adjacency must be checked in every rule that combines heads and arguments or adjuncts.
    This is the principle of adjacency, stated as follows: In a headed phrase, the SUBCAT.SAT value on the non-head daughter must not contain any adjacent arguments.
    In a headcomplement structure, the SUBCAT.SAT value of the head daughter must not contain any adjacent arguments besides the nonhead daughter.
    In a head-adjunct structure, the SUBCAT.SAT value of the head d
