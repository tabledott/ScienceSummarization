ed n = 10 joint assignments for training re-ranking models, and n = 15 for testing.
    The weight &#945; of the local model was set to 1.
    Using different numbers of joint assignments in training and testing is in general not ideal, but due to memory requirements, we could not experiment with larger values of n for training.
    Figure 10 shows the summary performance of the local model (LOCAL), repeated from earlier figures, a joint model using only local features (JOINTLOCAL), a joint model using local + whole label sequence features (LABELSEQ), and a joint model using all described types of features (ALLJOINT).
    The evaluation is on gold-standard parse trees.
    In addition to performance measures, the figure shows the number of binary features included in the model.
    The number of features is a measure of the complexity of the hypothesis space of the parametric model.
    We can see that a joint model using only local features outperforms a local model by .5 points of F-Measure.
