out to be higher than its lowest point of attachment (for the more general sense of attachment defined above) without such initial states causing the parser to garden path.
    Because of the nature of &amp;quot;D&amp;quot;, the parser can in this sense &amp;quot;lower&amp;quot; a constituent without falsifying a previous predication.
    The earlier predication remains indelible.
    But how can such a list of domination predications be interpreted?
    It would seem that compositional semantics must depend upon being able to determine exactly what the immediate constituents of any given structure are: if the meaning of a phrase determined from the meanings of its parts, then it must be determined exactly what its parts are.
    We assume that semantic interpretation of a D-theory analysis is done by taking such an analysis as describing the minimal tree possible, i.e. by taking &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; to mean directly dominates wherever possible but only for semantic analysis.
    For example. if the analysis
