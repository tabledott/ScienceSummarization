arning the scope of hedge signals inside or outside of the biomedical domain, which makes a direct comparison with the approaches described here impossible.
  
  
    The system has been developed using the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008; Vincze et al., 2008)2, a freely available resource that consists of medical and biological texts.
    In the corpus, every sentence is annotated with information about negation and speculation.
    The annotation indicates the boundaries of the scope and the keywords, as shown in (1) above.
    In the annotation, scopes are extended to the biggest syntactic unit possible, so that scopes have the maximal length, and the speculation cue is always included in the scope.
    The BioScope corpus consists of three parts: clinical free-texts (radiology reports), biological full papers and biological paper abstracts from the GENIA corpus (Collier et al., 1999).
    Table 1 shows statistics about the corpora.
    Hedge cues are represented by one or more tokens, as (2) shows,
