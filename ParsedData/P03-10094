    Levin&#8217;s taxonomy of verbs and their classes (Levin, 1993) is the largest syntactic-semantic verb classification in English, employed widely in evaluation of automatic classifications.
    It provides a classification of 3,024 verbs (4,186 senses) into 48 broad / 192 fine grained classes.
    Although it is quite extensive, it is not exhaustive.
    As it primarily concentrates on verbs taking NP and PP complements and does not provide a comprehensive set of senses for verbs, it is not suitable for evaluation of polysemic classifications.
    We employed as a gold standard a substantially extended version of Levin&#8217;s classification constructed by Korhonen (2003).
    This incorporates Levin&#8217;s classes, 26 additional classes by Dorr (1997)1, and 57 new classes for verb types not covered comprehensively by Levin or Dorr.
    110 test verbs were chosen from this gold standard, 78 polysemic and 32 monosemous ones.
