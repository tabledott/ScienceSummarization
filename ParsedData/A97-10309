gning Nominator, we have tried to achieve a balance between high accuracy and speed by adopting a model which uses minimal context and world knowledge.
    Nominator uses no syntactic contextual information.
    It applies a set of heuristics to a list of (multi-word) strings, based on patterns of capitalization, punctuation and location within the sentence and the document.
    This design choice differentiates our approach from that of several similar projects.
    Most proper name recognizers that have been reported on in print either take as input text tagged by part-of-speech (e.g., the systems of (Paik et al. 1993) and (Mani et al.
    1993)) or perform syntactic and/or morphological analysis on all words, including capitalized ones, that are part of candidate proper names (e.g., (Coates-Stephens 1993) and (McDonald 1993)).
    Several (e.g., (McDonald 1993), (Mani et al. 1993), (Paik et al.
    1993) and (Cowie et al. 1992)) look in the local context of the candidate proper name for external informatio
