    Koehn et al. (2003a) showed that translation quality is very sensitive to how this table is extracted from the training data.
    One particularly surprising result is that a simple heuristic extraction algorithm based on surface statistics of a word-aligned training set outperformed the phrase-based generative model proposed by Marcu and Wong (2002).
    This result is surprising in light of the reverse situation for word-based statistical translation.
    Specifically, in the task of word alignment, heuristic approaches such as the Dice coefficient consistently underperform their re-estimated counterparts, such as the IBM word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993).
    This well-known result is unsurprising: reestimation introduces an element of competition into the learning process.
