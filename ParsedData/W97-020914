 he reports a &amp;quot;% correct,&amp;quot; apparently treating a sense assignment as correct if any of the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; senses is chosen - his experiments have a lower bound (chance) of about 40% correct, with his algorithm performing at 53-55%, considering only ambiguous cases.
    The best results reported for an unsupervised sense disambiguation method are those of Yarowsky (1992), who uses evidence from a wider context (a window of 100 surrounding words) to build up a co-occurrence model using classes from Roget's thesaurus.
    He reports accuracy figures in the 72-99% range (mean 92%) in disambiguating test instances involving twelve &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; polysemous words.
    As in the experiments by Cowie et al., the choice of coarser distinctions presumably accounts in part for the high accuracy.
    By way of comparison, some words in Yarowsky's test set would require choosing among ten senses in WordNet, as compared to a maximum of six using the Roget's thesaurus categories;
