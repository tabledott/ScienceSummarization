pgraded with programs for sentence alignment.
    Most of the proposed algorithms first conduct an alignment of sentences, that is, they locate those pairs of sentences that are translations of each other.
    In a second step a word alignment is performed by analyzing the correspondences of words in each pair of sentences.
    The algorithms are usually based on one or several of the following statistical clues: All these clues usually work well for parallel texts.
    However, despite serious efforts in the compilation of parallel corpora (Armstrong et al., 1998), the availability of a large-enough parallel corpus in a specific domain and for a given pair of languages is still an exception.
    Since the acquisition of monolingual corpora is much easier, it would be desirable to have a program that can determine the translations of words from comparable (same domain) or possibly unrelated monolingual texts of two languages.
    This is what translators and interpreters usually do when preparing terminology
