r recall due to the high number offalse positives that may arise if there is no thresh olding.
			This is a tactic also used for determiner selection in (Nagata et al, 2006) and (Han et al, 2006).
			Both thresholds were empirically set on a development corpus.
			2.3 Combination Features.
			ME is an attractive choice of machine learning al gorithm for a problem as complex as preposition error detection, in no small part because of theavailability of ME implementations that can han dle many millions of training events and features.
			However, one disadvantage of ME is that it does not automatically model the interactions amongfeatures as some other approaches do, such as sup port vector machines (Jurafsky and Martin, 2008).To overcome this, we have experimented with aug menting our original feature set with ?combinationfeatures?
			which represent richer contextual struc ture in the form of syntactic patterns.Table 1 (first column) illustrates the four com bination features used for the example context ?tak
