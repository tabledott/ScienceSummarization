, with this dataset we can assess the additional benefit of using rules tailored to an individual language as opposed to universal rules.
  
  
    Datasets and Evaluation We test the effectiveness of our grammar induction approach on English, Danish, Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish.
    For English we use the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), transformed from CFG parses into dependencies with the Collins head finding rules (Collins, 1999); for the other languages we use data from the 2006 CoNLL-X Shared Task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).
    Each dataset provides manually annotated part-of-speech tags that are used for both training and testing.
    For comparison purposes with previous work, we limit the cross-lingual experiments to sentences of length 10 or less (not counting punctuation).
    For English, we also explore sentences of length up to 20.
    The final output metric is directed dependency accuracy.
    This is computed based on the Viterbi parses produced using the final unnormalize
