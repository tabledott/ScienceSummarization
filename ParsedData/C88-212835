onstraint of string concatenation i  context-free grammars allows a goal sentence to be systematically decomposed so that a dynamic-programming parsing process can be indexed by the subparts of that decomposition (the 14Such a proof is currently in preparation.

  And just az the concatenation restriction of context-free grammars can be problematic, so can the restriction of semantic mono- tonicity.
  Finding a weaker constraint on grammars that still allows efficient processing is thus an important research objective.
  Even with the semantic-monotonicity onstraint, he process of in- dexing by the highly structured logical forms is not nearly so efficient as indexing by simple integer string positions.
