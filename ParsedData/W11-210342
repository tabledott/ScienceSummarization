ion task (Haitian Creole SMS into English).
    This year was also the first time that we included a language pair (Haitian-English) with non-European source language and with very limited resources for the source language side.
    Also the genre of the Haitian-English task differed from previous WMT tasks as the Haitian-English translations are SMS messages.
    WMT11 also introduced a new shared task focusing on evaluation metrics to tune the parameters of a statistical machine translation system in which 6 groups have participated.
    As in previous years, all data sets generated by this workshop, including the human judgments, system translations and automatic scores, are publicly available for other researchers to analyze.8
