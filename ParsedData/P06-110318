ts of dictionary words with their translations as described in Section 3.1.
    We achieved the accuracy of about 66%.
    The correctly discovered Russian NEs included entirely transliterated, partially translated, and entirely translated NEs.
    Some of them are shown on Figure 6.
    We ran a series of experiments to see how the size of the initial training set affects the accuracy of the model as training progresses (Figure 4).
    Although the performance of the early iterations is significantly affected by the size of the initial training example set, the algorithm quickly improves its performance.
    As we decrease the size from 80 to 20, the accuracy of the first iteration drops by over 20%, but a few iterations later the two have similar performance.
    However, when initialized with the set of size 5, the algorithm never manages to improve.
    The intuition is the following.
    The few examples in the initial training set produce features corresponding to substring pairs characteristic for Engl
