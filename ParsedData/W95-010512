 also a nanny.
    When the two words are considered together, however, the shared element of meaning for the two relevant senses emerges in the form of the most informative subsumer.
    It may be that other pairings of possible senses also share elements of meaning (for example, doctor/Ph.D. and nurse/nanny are both descendants of (person, individual)).
    However, in cases like those illustrated above, the more specific or informative the shared ancestor is, the more strongly it suggests which senses come to mind when the words are considered together.
    The working hypothesis in this paper is that this holds true in general.
    Turning that observation into an algorithm requires two things: a way to assign credit to word senses based on similarity with co-occurring words, and a tractable way to generalize to the case where more than two polysemous words are involved.
    The algorithm given in Figure 1 does both quite straightforwardly.
