sp), whose value is the word overlap of the sentences in sp.
    According to the ME principle, the optimal parametric form of the model of our data, taking into account the constraints imposed by the feature functions, is a log linear combination of these functions.
    Thus, for our classification problem, we have: where ci is the class (c0=&#8221;parallel&#8221;, c1=&#8221;not parallel&#8221;), Z(sp) is a normalization factor, and fij are the feature functions (indexed both by class and by feature).
    The resulting model has free parameters &#955;j, the feature weights.
    The parameter values that maximize the likelihood of a given training corpus can be computed using various optimization algorithms (see [Malouf 2002] for a comparison of such algorithms).
    For our particular classification problem, we need to find feature functions that distinguish between parallel and non-parallel sentence pairs.
    For this purpose, we compute and exploit word-level alignments between the sentences in each pair.
