sarily superior to smoothing or that it should be generally preferred over smoothing methods.
    However, the next section will present a small-scale study that compares the performance of several smoothing techniques with the performance of Web counts on a standard task from the literature.
    In the smoothing literature, re-created frequencies are typically evaluated using pseudodisambiguation (Clark and Weir 2001; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999; Lee 1999; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth 2000; Rooth et al. 1999).
    The aim of the pseudodisambiguation task is to decide whether a given algorithm re-creates frequencies that make it possible to distinguish between seen and unseen bigrams in a given corpus.
    A set of pseudobigrams is constructed according to a set of criteria (detailed below) that ensure that they are unattested in the training corpus.
    Then the seen bigrams are removed from the training data, and the smoothing method is used to re-create the frequencies of bo
