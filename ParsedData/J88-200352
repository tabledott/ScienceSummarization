temporality.
    The notion of nucleus plays a crucial role in this ontology.
    The process of temporal reference involves reference to the appropriate part of a nucleus, where appropriateness is a function of the inherent meaning of the core expression, of the coercive nature of co-occurring linguistic expressions, and of particular and general knowledge about the area of discourse.
    The identification of the correct ontology is also a vital preliminary to the construction and management of temporal databases.
    Effective exchange of information between people and machines is easier if the datastructures that are used to organise the information in the machine correspond in a natural way to the conceptual structures people use to organise the same information.
    In fact, the penalties for a bad fit between data-structures and human concepts are usually crippling for any attempt to provide natural language interfaces for database systems.
    Information extracted from natural-language text can only
