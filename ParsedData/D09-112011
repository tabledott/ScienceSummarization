take the approach that in order to align a non-pronominal mention to an antecedent without an identical head, we require evidence that the mentions are compatible.
    Judging compatibility of mentions generally requires semantic knowledge, to which we return later.
    However, some syntactic configurations guarantee coreference.
    The one exploited most in coreference work (Soon et al., 1999; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Luo et al., 2004; Culotta et al., 2007; Poon and Domingos, 2008; Bengston and Roth, 2008) is the appositive construction.
    Here, we represent apposition as a syntactic feature of an NP indicating that it is coreferent with its parent NP (e.g. it is an exception to the i-within-i constraint that parent and child NPs cannot be coreferent).
    We deterministically mark a node as NP-APPOS (see Figure 3) when it is the third child in of a parent NP whose expansion begins with (NP , NP), and there is not a conjunction in the expansion (to avoid marking elements in a list as appositive).
