  The syntactic structures and corresponding CLCS are shown here: (12) [C-MAX [I--MAX IN-MAX I] [V-MAX [V like] [N-MAX Mary]]]] [State BEIdent ([Thing II, [Position aTIdent ([Thing I], [Thing MARY])], [Manner LIKINGLY])] [C-MAX [I-MAX IN-MAX Maria] [V-MAX IV me gusta]l]] 1?
  Here the object Mary has reversed places with the subject I in the Spanish translation.

  The lexical entries for like and gustar illustrate the difference in the use of these parameters: (13) (i) (ii) Lexical entry for like: [State BEIdent ([Thing W], [Position aTIdent ([Thing Wl, [Thing Z])], [Manner LIKINGLYI)] Lexical entry for gustar: [State BEldent ([Thing :INT W], [Position aTIdent ([Thing
