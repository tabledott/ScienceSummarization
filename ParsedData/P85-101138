  We will now show why L~G1) m U T ~ L R. Let w E I~GI).
  Then there is a sequence of adjoining operations starting with uu inithd tree a to derive w. Obviowdy, w E L.F, also since corresponding to ensh tree used in deriving w, there is n corresponding tree in G, which diffem only in the constraints asm?inted with its nodes.
  Note, however, that the coutraints aloeinted with the nodes in tre~ in G z are just a reatriction of the corresponding om in G, or an obligatory constraint where there wu noes in G. Now, if we can amume ( by induction hypothesis ) that if after n adjoining operation we cam derive "/ E D(a).
  there is a corresponding tree ~, E D(a) in G, which bus the same tree structure as 7 but differm| only in the constraints aasociated with the corl~sponding nodes, then if we adjoin at some ..ode in "7 to obtain ~t.
  we can adjoin in "T to obtain "ft (corresponding to "it).
  Therefore, if w can be derived in Gt, then it eu  definitely be derived inG.
  If we can abe 8bow that l,(Gt) ~ 14,
