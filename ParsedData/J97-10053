structure) and linguistic features of utterances' is almost universally acknowledged in the literature on discourse.
    However, natural language systems rarely exploit the relation between discourse segment structure and linguistic devices because there is very little data about how they constrain one another.
    We have been engaged in a two-part study addressing this gap.
    We report on a method for empirically validating discourse segments, and on our development and evaluation of algorithms to identify these segments from linguistic features of discourse.
    We show that human subjects can reliably perform discourse segmentation using speaker intention as a criterion.
    We also show that when multiple sources of linguistic knowledge are used (referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses), algorithm performance approaches human performance.
    The excerpt in Figure 1 illustrates the two aspects of discourse that our study addresses.'
    The first pertains to an abstract structure consisting of
