rameNet taggers.
    For example, run 08a asserted many more frame elements than were identified in the answer key.
    As a result, its percent attempted was much higher than 100 percent.
    The number of frame elements in other runs not identified in the answer key is unknown.
    The effect of a higher number attempted lowers the precision for a run and increases the percent attempted.
  
  
    Overall, the results achieved in this SENSEVAL-3 task were quite high.
    Several teams achieved results much better than those obtained by Gildea and Jurafsky.
    The average precision of 0.80 for all runs in the unrestricted case is only slightly lower than the 82% accuracy achieved in that study when using presegmented constituents.
    Many teams achieved precision at or above 0.90, indicating that their routines for classifying constituents is quite good.
    In view of the fact that the number of frames and frame elements in FrameNet has expanded considerably since the Gildea and Jurafsky study, it appears
