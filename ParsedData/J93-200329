e words in I.
    Different monomials correspond to different ways of connecting words in f to cepts in e with every way appearing exactly once.
    By direct evaluation, we see that An example may help to clarify this.
    Suppose that m = 3 and 1 = 1, and that we write as a shorthand for t(fii et).
    Then the left-hand side of Equation (15) is t10 tzo t30 t10 t20 t31 +&amp;quot; +41 t21 t30 tll t21 t31, and the right-hand side is (tip +t11)(t20 &#177;t21)(t30 +t31)&#8226; It is routine to verify that these are the same.
    Therefore, we can interchange the sums in Equation (6) with the product to obtain If we use this expression in place of Equation (6) when we write the auxiliary function in Equation (8), we find that count of e in e Thus, the number of operations necessary to calculate a count is proportional to 1+ m rather than to (1 + 1)rn as Equation (12) might suggest.
    Using Equations (14) and (17), we can estimate the parameters t(f le) as follows.
    The details of our initial guesses for t(
