h attains an accuracy of 56% (Turney, 2006).
			Another reason to prefer a corpus-based approachto a lexicon-based approach is that the former re quires less human labour, and thus it is easier to extend to other languages.In Section 2, we describe our algorithm for rec ognizing analogies.
			We use a standard supervised 905 machine learning approach, with feature vectorsbased on the frequencies of patterns in a large cor pus.
			We use a support vector machine (SVM) to learn how to classify the feature vectors (Platt, 1998; Witten and Frank, 1999).
			Section 3 presents four sets of experiments.
			We apply our algorithm for recognizing analogies to multiple-choice analogy questions from the SAT college entrance test, multiple-choice synonym questions from the TOEFL (test of English as aforeign language), ESL (English as a second language) practice questions for distinguishing syn onyms and antonyms, and a set of word pairs thatare labeled similar, associated, and both, devel oped for experiments in cognitiv
