nds of sources on the World Wide Web, thereby permitting the system to operate outside the narrow domains typical of existing systems.
  
  
    Until recently, efforts in paraphrase were not strongly focused on generation and relied primarily on narrow data sources.
    One data source has been multiple translations of classic literary works (Barzilay &amp; McKeown 2001; Ibrahim 2002; Ibrahim et al. 2003).
    Pang et al. (2003) obtain parallel monolingual texts from a set of 100 multiply-translated news articles.
    While translation-based approaches to obtaining data do address the problem of how to identify two strings as meaning the same thing, they are limited in scalability owing to the difficulty (and expense) of obtaining large quantities of multiply-translated source documents.
    Other researchers have sought to identify patterns in large unannotated monolingual corpora.
    Lin &amp; Pantel (2002) derive inference rules by parsing text fragments and extracting semantically similar paths.
