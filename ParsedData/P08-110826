l is essentially an instance of the graph-based model, where arc scores are derived from the output of the different component parsers.
    Unlike the models presented here, integration takes place only at parsing time, not at learning time, and requires at least three different base parsers.
    The same technique was used by Hall et al. (2007) to combine six transition-based parsers in the best performing system in the CoNLL 2007 shared task.
    Feature-based integration in the sense of letting a subset of the features for one model be derived from the output of a different model has been exploited for dependency parsing by McDonald (2006), who trained an instance of MSTParser using features generated by the parsers of Collins (1999) and Charniak (2000), which improved unlabeled accuracy by 1.7 percentage points, again on data from the Penn Treebank.
    In addition, feature-based integration has been used by Taskar et al. (2005), who trained a discriminative word alignment model using features derived fro
