 The normalizing coefficient is constant over all words.
    The only difference between Equations 16 and 18 is that the former discounts co-occurrences proportionally to the segment lengths.
    When information about segment lengths is not available, the only information available to initialize Model 1 is the co-occurrence counts.
    This property makes Model 1 an appropriate baseline for comparison to more sophisticated models that use other information sources, both in the work of Brown and his colleagues and in the work described here. the true bitext map correlate with the positions of their translations.
    The correlation is stronger for language pairs with more similar word order.
    Brown et al. (1988) introduced the idea that this correlation can be encoded in translation model parameters.
    Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993) expanded on this idea by replacing Brown et al. 's (1988) word alignment parameters, which were based on absolute word positions in aligned segments, with a much smaller set
