    Our conversations are not restricted to any particular topic: Twitter users can and will talk about anything.
    Therefore, there is no guarantee that our model, charged with discovering clusters of posts that aid in the prediction of the next cluster, will necessarily discover dialogue acts.
    The sequence model could instead partition entire conversations into topics, such as food, computers and music, and then predict that each topic self-transitions with high probability: if we begin talking about food, we are likely to continue to do so.
    Since we began with a content model, it is perhaps not surprising that our Conversation Model tends to discover a mixture of dialogue and topic structure.
    Several high probability posts from a topic-focused cluster discovered by EM are shown in Table 2.
    These clusters are undesirable, as they have little to do with dialogue structure.
    In general, unsupervised sentence clustering techniques need some degree of direction when a partic
