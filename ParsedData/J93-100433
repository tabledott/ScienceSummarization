mal tests of the error rate in the Hansards suggest that the overall error rate is about 2%, while the error rate for the easy 80% of the sentences is about 0.4%.
    Apparently the Hansard translations are more literal than the UBS reports.
    It took 20 hours of real time on a sun 4 to align 367 days of Hansards, or 3.3 minutes per Hansard-day.
    The 367 days of Hansards contained about 890,000 sentences or about 37 million &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; (tokens).
    About half of the computer time is spent identifying tokens, sentences, and paragraphs, and about half of the time is spent in the align program itself.
    The overall error, 4.2%, that we get on the UBS corpus is considerably higher than the 0.6% error reported by Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991).
    However, a direct comparison is misleading because of the differences in corpora and the differences in sampling.
    We have observed that the Hansards are much easier than the UBS.
    Our error rate drops by about 50% in that case.
