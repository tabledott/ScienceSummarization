ifference is that their template extracts contextual information from noun phrases surrounding the predicate, rather than from the sequence of argument nodes.
    Because our model is joint, we are able to use information about other argument nodes when labeling a node.
    Here we describe the application in testing of a joint model for semantic role labeling, using a local model P`SRL, and a joint re-ranking model PrSRL.
    P`SRL is used to generate top N non-overlapping joint assignments L1, ... , LN.
    One option is to select the best Li according to PrSRL, as in Equation 3, ignoring the score from the local model.
    In our experiments, we noticed that for larger values of N, the performance of our reranking model PrSRL decreased.
    This was probably due to the fact that at test time the local classifier produces very poor argument frames near the bottom of the top N for large N. Since the re-ranking model is trained on relatively few good argument frames, it cannot easily rule out very bad frames.
