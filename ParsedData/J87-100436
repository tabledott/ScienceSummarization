d does not seem to be affected very much by the length of sentence or the size of grammar, as discussed in section 5.
    We expect further improvements for fully segmented sentences (such as English) where words rather then characters are the atomic units.
    A commercial on-line parser for Japanese language is being developed in Common Lisp jointly by Intelligent Technology Incorporation (ITI) and Carnegie Group Incorporation (CGI), based on the technique developed at CMU.
    Finally, in the continuous speech recognition project at CMU (Hayes et al. 1986), the on-line parsing algoComputational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 1-2, January-June 1987 45 Masaru Tomita An Efficient Augmented-Context-Free Parsing Algorithm rithm is being extended to handle speech input, to make the speech parsing process efficient and capable of being pipelined with lower level processes such as acoustic/phonetic level recognition (Tomita 1986).
