use selectional constraints to convey new information, so they are given the same cost as definite noun phrases.
    Coercion relations and the compound nominal relations are given a very high cost, say, $20, since to assume them is to fail to solve the interpretation problem.
    If we superscript the atoms in the above logical form by their assumability costs, we get the following expression: (3e, x, c, kl, k2, y, a, o)Past(e)&amp;quot; A disengage' (e, x, c)&amp;quot; A compressor(c)&amp;quot; A after(ki, k2)&amp;quot; A event(k2 )S1&#176; A rel(ki,y)sss A y E {c, e} A event( k2)11&#176; A rel(k2, a)s&amp;quot; A alarm(a)55 A nn(o, a)82&#176; A lube-oil(o)55 While this example gives a rough idea of the relative assumability costs, the real costs must mesh well with the inference processes and thus must be determined experimentally.
    The use of numbers here and throughout the next section constitutes one possible regime with the needed properties.
    We are at present working, and with some optimism, on
