 trained on sections 2-21 of the Penn treebank with dependencies extracted using the head rules of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003b).
    For Bulgarian we trained the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) on the Bulgtreebank corpus from CoNLL X.
    The Spanish Europarl data was POS tagged with the FreeLing language analyzer (Atserias et al., 2006).
    The discriminative model used the same features as MSTParser, summarized in Table 1.
    In order to evaluate our method, we a baseline inspired by Hwa et al. (2005).
    The baseline constructs a full parse tree from the incomplete and possibly conflicting transferred edges using a simple random process.
    We start with no edges and try to add edges one at a time verifying at each step that it is possible to complete the tree.
    We first try to add the transferred edges in random order, then for each orphan node we try all possible parents (both in random order).
    We then use this full labeling as supervision for a parser.
    Note that this baseline
