ublanguage 2) selecting the correct analysis from the set licensed by the grammar and 3) providing reliable analyses of input outside the coverage of the grammar.
    Firstly, it is clear that vocabulary, idiom, and conventionalized constructions used in, say, legal language and dictionary definitions, will differ both in terms of the range and frequency of words and constructions deployed.
    Secondly, Church and Patil (1982) demonstrate that for a realistic grammar parsing realistic input, the set of possible analyses licensed by the grammar can be in the thousands.
    Finally, it is extremely unlikely that any generative grammar will ever be capable of correctly analyzing all naturally occurring input, even when tuned for a particular corpus or sublanguage (if only because of the synchronic idealization implicit in the assumption that the set of grammatical sentences of a language is well formed.)
    In this paper, we describe our approach to the first and second problems and make some preliminary remar
