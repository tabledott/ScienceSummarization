owing normalization can be maintained.
			If the behavior of the measure is so unstable before normalization can users reasonably expect stable behavior following normalization?
			A final class of cluster evaluation measures arebased on information theory.
			These measures analyze the distribution of class and cluster member ship in order to determine how successful a givenclustering solution is or how different two parti tions of a data set are.
			We have already examined one member of this class of measures, Entropy.
			From a coding theory perspective, Entropy is theweighted average of the code lengths of each cluster.
			Our V-measure is a member of this class of clustering measures.
			One significant advantage that in formation theoretic evaluation measures have is that they provide an elegant solution to the ?problem of matching?.
			By examining the relative sizes of the classes and clusters being evaluated, these measures all evaluate the entire membership of each cluster ? not just a ?matched?
