 to perform a more detailed analysis of linguistic phenomena that violate certain constraints.
    Another important line of research is the integration of these constraints into parsing algorithms for non-projective dependency structures, potentially leading to a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency than that obtained with existing methods.
