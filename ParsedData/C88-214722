  Let us now consider the representation f trees in FTAG and the feature structures that are a~sociated with the nodes.
  The elementary feature structure associated with each elementary tree encodes certain relationships between the nodes.
  Included among these relationships are the sibling and ancestor/descendent relationships; in short, the actual structure of the tree.
  Thus, associated with each node is a feature struc- ture which encodes the subtree below it.
  We use the attributes i E .hf to denote the i ~h child of a node.
  To understand the representation f the adjunction process, consider the trees given in Figure 4, and in particular, the node y.
  The feature structure associated with the node where adjunction takes place should reflect the feature structure afte
