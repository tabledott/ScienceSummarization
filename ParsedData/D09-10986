asses, for which large unlabeled data sets are available.
    Previous work has examined the effect of using large, sometimes Web-size corpora, on system performance in the case of familiar NLP tasks.
    Banko and Brill (2001) show that Web-scale data helps with confusion set disambiguation while Lapata and Keller (2005) find that the Web is a good source of n-gram counts for unsupervised models.
    Atterer and Schutze (2006) examine the influence of corpus size on combining a supervised approach with an unsupervised one for relative clause and PP-attachment.
    Etzioni et al. (2005) and Pantel et al.
    (2004) show the advantages of using large quantities of generic Web text over smaller corpora for extracting relations and named entities.
    Overall, corpus size and quality are both found to be important for extraction.
    Our paper adds to this body of work by focusing on the task of similarity-based set expansion and providing a large empirical study quantify the relative corpus effects.
