			The traditional approach to cross-lingual QA isthat translation is either a pre-processing or post processing step done independently from the main QA task.
			Notice that the QG formalism that we have employed in this work was originally proposed formachine translation.
			We might envision transformations that are performed together to form ques tions from answers (or vice versa) and to translate?
			a Jeopardy!
			game in which bilingual players must ask a question in a different language than that in which the answer is posed.
	
	
			We described a statistical syntax-based model that softly aligns a question sentence with a candidateanswer sentence and returns a score.
			Discriminative training and a relatively straightforward, barelyengineered feature set were used in the implementation.
			Our scoring model was found to greatly out perform two state-of-the-art baselines on an answer selection task using the TREC dataset.
