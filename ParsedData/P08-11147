istically sensible constituents, and in practice they frequently do not.3 Chiang (2005) conjectured that there might be value in allowing the Hiero model to favor hypotheses for which the synchronous derivation respects linguistically motivated source-language constituency boundaries, as identified using a parser.
    He tested this conjecture by adding a soft constraint in the form of a &#8220;constituency feature&#8221;: if a synchronous rule X &#8212;* (e, f) is used in a derivation, and the span of f is a constituent in the sourcelanguage parse, then a term a, is added to the model score in expression (1).4 Unlike a hard constraint, which would simply prevent the application of rules violating syntactic boundaries, using the feature to introduce a soft constraint allows the model to boost the &#8220;goodness&#8221; for a rule if it is constitent with the source language constituency analysis, and to leave its score unchanged otherwise.
    The weight a,, like all other aZ, is set via minimum error rate tr
