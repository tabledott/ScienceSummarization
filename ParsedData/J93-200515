ion of this in Section 3, and to how this space relates to statistically significant collocations in text.
    It is our view that the approach outlined above for representing lexical knowledge can be put to use in the service of information retrieval tasks.
    In this respect, our proposal can be compared to attempts at object classification in information science.
    One approach, known as faceted classification (Vickery 1975) proceeds roughly as follows: collect all terms lying within a field; then group the terms into facets by assigning them to categories.
    Typical examples of this are state, property, reaction, and device.
    However, each subject area is likely to have its own sets of categories, which makes it difficult to re-use a set of facet classifications.9 Even if the relational information provided by the qualia structure and inheritance would improve performance in information retrieval tasks, one problem still remains, namely that it would be very time-consuming to hand-code such struct
