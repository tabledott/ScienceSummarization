though transition types are not domain-specific, their distribution could vary from one domain to another.
    To give a simple example, some domains will have more entities than others (e.g., descriptive texts).
    In other words, entity transitions capture not only text coherence properties, but also reflect stylistic and genre-specific discourse properties.
    This hypothesis is indirectly confirmed by the observed differences in the contribution of various linguistic features across the two domains discussed above.
    Cross-domain differences in the distribution and occurrence of entities have been also observed in other empirical studies of local coherence.
    For instance, Poesio et al. (2004) show differences in transition types between instructional texts and descriptions of museum texts.
    In Section 6, we show that features derived from the entity grid help determine the readability level for a given text, thereby verifying more directly the hypothesis that the grid representation captures sty
