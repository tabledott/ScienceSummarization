ion was not designed for the purpose of parser evaluation.
    Nevertheless, we agree with the widespread sentiment that dependency-based evaluation of parsers avoids many of the problems of the traditional Parseval measures (Black et al., 1991), and to the extent that the Stanford dependency representation is an effective representation for the tasks envisioned, it is perhaps closer to an appropriate taskbased evaluation than some of the alternative dependency representations available.
    In this paper we examine the representation and its underlying design principles, look at how this representation compares with other dependency representations in ways that reflect the design principles, and consider its suitability for parser evaluation.
    A major problem for the natural language processing (NLP) community is how to make the very impressive and practical technology which has been developed over the last two decades approachable to and usable by everyone who has text understanding needs.
