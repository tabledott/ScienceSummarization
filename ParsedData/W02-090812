 functions involving logarithms or differences is that they can be negative.
    The results in Table 6 show that weight functions that are not bounded below by zero do not perform as well on thesaurus extraction.
    However, unbounded weights do produce interesting and unexpected results: they tend to return misspellings of the term and synonyms, abbreviations and lower frequency synonyms.
    For instance, TTEST' returned Co, Co. and PLC for company, but they do not appear in the synonyms extracted with TTEST.
    The unbounded weights also extracted more hyponyms, such as corporation names for company, including Kodak and Exxon.
    Finally unbounded weights tended to promote the rankings of synonyms from minority senses because the frequent senses are demoted by negative weights.
    For example, TTEST' returned writings, painting, fieldwork, essay and masterpiece as the best synonyms for work, whereas TTEST returned study, research, job, activity and life.
