 these tasks: document clustering has been notably more successfully applied than pitch accent clustering.
			These examples allow us to observe how transparently V-measure can be used to compare the behavior across distinct data sets.
	
	
			We have presented a new external cluster evaluation measure, V-measure, and compared it with existing clustering evaluation measures.
			V-measure is basedupon two criteria for clustering usefulness, homogeneity and completeness, which capture a clustering solution?s success in including all and only data points from a given class in a given cluster.
			We havealso demonstrated V-measure?s usefulness in com paring clustering success across different domainsby evaluating document and pitch accent cluster ing solutions.
			We believe that V-measure addressessome of the problems that affect other cluster measures.
			1) It evaluates a clustering solution indepen dent of the clustering algorithm, size of the data set, number of classes and number of clusters.
			2) It does n
