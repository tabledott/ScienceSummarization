ction), and Y represents candidate translations in French (for the credit cards example: cartes, cartes credit, cartes credit taux, and cartes credit taux paient).
    The correct translations are again shown in bold.
    The third and fourth columns give the independent frequencies of each word group, while the fifth column gives the number of times that both groups appear in matched sentences.
    The two subsequent columns give the similarity values computed according to the Dice coefficient and specific mutual information (in bits).
    The corpus used for these examples contained 54,944 sentences in each language.
    We see from Table 4 that, as for the today example in Table 2, the SI scores are very close to each other and fail to select the correct candidate whereas the Dice scores cover a wider range and clearly peak for the correct translation.
    In conclusion, both theoretical arguments and experimental results support the choice of the Dice coefficient over average or specific mutual informatio
