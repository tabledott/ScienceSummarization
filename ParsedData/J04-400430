tself, where, because of the chain rule, the conditioning context consists of everything in the histories of expressions (7) and (8) plus the partially lexicalized modifier.
    As there are some interesting idiosyncrasies with these headword-generation parameters, we describe them in more detail in Section 6.9.
    6.5.1 Inconsistent Model.
    As discussed in Section 4.8, punctuation is raised to the highest position in the tree.
    This means that in some sense, punctuation acts very much like a coordinating conjunction, in that it &#8220;conjoins&#8221; the two siblings between which it sits.
    Observing that it might be helpful for conjunctions to be generated conditioning on both of their conjuncts, Collins introduced two new parameter classes in his thesis parser, Ppunc and PCC.18 As per the definition of a coordinated phrase in Section 4.1, conjunction via a CC node or a punctuation node always occurs posthead (i.e., as a right-sibling of the head).
    Put another way, if a conjunction or punctuat
