ng they found a strong cohesion among noun phrases, even when comparing English to Czech, a relatively free word order language.
    Other than this, there is little in the SMT literature to validate the coherence assumption.
    Several studies have reported alignment or translation performance for syntactically augmented translation models (Wu, 1997; Wang, 1998; Alshawi et al., 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Jones and Havrilla, 1998) and these results have been promising.
    However, without a focused study of the behavior of phrases across languages, we cannot know how far these models can take us and what specific pitfalls they face.
    The particulars of cohesion will clearly depend upon the pair of languages being compared.
    Intuitively, we expect that while French and Spanish will have a high degree of cohesion, French and Japanese may not.
    It is also clear that if the cohesion between two closely related languages is not high enough to be useful, then there is no hope for these methods when a
