OUGH-SHIFT.
    In my algorithm, at the end of (2c) the evoked phrase &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; is ranked higher than the brand-new phrase &amp;quot;a professional driver&amp;quot; (cf.
    Table 4).
    In both (2d) and (2d') the pronoun &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; is resolved to BRENNAN.
    Example (3)8 illustrates how the preferences for intra- and inter-sentential anaphora interact with the information status of discourse entitites (Table 5).
    Sentence (3a) starts a new discourse segment.
    The phrase &amp;quot;a judge&amp;quot; is brand-new.
    &amp;quot;Mr Curtis&amp;quot; is mentioned several times before in the text, Hence, 71 owe this variant Andrew Kehler.
    &#8212;This example can misdirect readers because the phrase &amp;quot;a professional driver&amp;quot; is assigned the &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; gender masculine.
    Anyway, this example &#8212; like the original example &#8212; seems not to be felicitous English and has only illustrative character.
