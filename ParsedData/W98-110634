ed a bomb&amp;quot;, as well as &amp;quot;the bomb detonated&amp;quot;.
    Both constructions are very common in the training corpus so the system added slots for both possibilities.
    It would be easy for a human to overlook some of these variations when creating case frames by hand.
    The case frame in Figure 8 is activated by the noun &amp;quot;attack&amp;quot; and includes slots for a variety of prepositional phrases.
    The same preposition can recognize different types of information (e.g., &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; can recognize targets, victims, locations, and dates).
    And the same role can be filled by different prepositions (e.g., targets can be extracted from &amp;quot;on&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;against&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;at&amp;quot;).
    This example again shows the power of corpus-based methods to identify common constructions empirically.
    Anticipating all of these prepositional arguments would be difficult for a person.
    A disadvantage of this automated method is that inappropri
