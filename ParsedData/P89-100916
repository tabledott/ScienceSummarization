 deep semantic struc- ture corresponding to the previous utterance with that corresponding to the current utterance, to identify any elements they have in common.
  The two distinct levels of semantic representation play an important role here: in the deep semantic struc- ture, only the basic semantic category of the de scription has special status (this is similar to Wel&gt;- hers (1979) use of restricted quantification), whereas the embedding of the surface semantic structures dcsc feature closely matches that of the noun phrase to be generated.
  For one-anaphora to be possi- ble, the two deep semantic structures being com- pared must have the same value for the feature addressed by the path &lt;sere spec type category&gt;.
  Rules which specify the relative ordering of ad- jectives in the surface form are then used to build an appropriately nested surface semantic structure which, when unified with the grammar, will result in the required one-anaphoric noun phrase.
  In the present example, this results
