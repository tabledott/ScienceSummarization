  In order for it to become a matrix sentence, it must undergo am adjuuction at its root node, for example, by the auxiliary tree ~2 as shown above.
  for a 2 we will specify a local constraint O(~2) for the root node, indicating that a 2 requires for it to undergo am adjuuction at the mot node by an auxiliary tree 02.
  In a fuller grammar there will be, of course, some alternatives in the scope of O().
