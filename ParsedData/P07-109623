eam even with left-to-right search in training.
    This can also explain why the performance of leftto-right search with non-aggressive learning is close to bidirectional search if the beam is large enough.
    However, with beam width = 1, non-aggressive learning over left-to-right search performs much worse, because in this case it is more likely that the gold-standard tag is not in the beam.
    This set of experiments show that guided learning is more preferable for tasks with higher ambiguities.
    In our recent work (Shen and Joshi, 2007), we have applied a variant of this algorithm to dependency parsing, and showed significant improvement over left-to-right non-aggressive learning strategy.
    Comparison: Table 4 shows the comparison with the previous works on the PTB test sections.
    According to the experiments shown above, we build our best system by using feature set E with beam width B = 3.
    The number of iterations on the training data is estimated with respect to the development data.
