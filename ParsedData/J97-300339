    Table 4 displays the tagging results on the unknown words obtained by the four different combinations of taggers and guessers.
    It shows the overall error rate on unknown words and also displays the distribution of the error rate and the coverage between unknown proper nouns and the other unknown words.
    Indeed the error rate on the proper nouns was much smaller than on the rest of the unknown words, which means that they are much easier to guess.
    We can also see a difference in the distribution (coverage) of the unknown words using different taggers.
    This can be accounted for by the fact that the unguessed capitalized words were taken by default to be proper nouns and that the Brill tagger and the HMM tagger had slightly different strategies to apply to the first word of a sentence.
    The cascading guesser outperformed the other two guessers in general and most importantly in the non-proper noun category, where it had an advantage of 6.5% over Brill's guesser and about 8.7% over Xerox's
