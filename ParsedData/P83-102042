ed as aliases of the one node that does exist in the corresponding standard referent; in this case all predications about whatever node is named by the alias remain true, and thus once again no predications need to be revoked.
    We now see how it is that D-theory gives an account of the intuition that the fine structure of coordinations in vague, in the sense of VanLehn.
    For we have seen that pragmatics does not need to determine whether (e.g.) all the fruits in (11.1) are ripe or not for the syntactic analysis to be completed deterministically, exactly because the D-theory analysis leaves all (and, we also claim, only) the syntactically correct possibilities open.
    Thus the description given in (12) is appropriately vague between possible syntactic analyses of sentences like those schematized in (11.3).
    Thus, this new representation opens the way for a simple formal expression of the notion that some sentences may be vague in certain well defined ways, even though they are believed to be underst
