his algorithm standardly uses the single training item closest to the test 3In a number of cases a different base configuration in one experiment series outperformed the best base configuration found in the previous series.
    In the second series L/R=1/2 outperformed 2/2 for 10E2 when chunk tags were added and in the third series chunk tag context 1/1 outperformed 1/2 for IOB1 when different combinations were tested. right classification tag context sizes for the seven representation formats using 5-fold cross-validation on section 15 of the WSJ corpus obtained with iBl-IG parameter k=3.
    IOB1 is the best representation format but the differences with the results of the other formats are not significant. item.
    However (Daelemans et al., 1999) report that for baseNP recognition better results can be obtained by making the algorithm consider the classification values of the three closest training items.
    We have tested this by repeating the first experiment series and part of the third experiment se
