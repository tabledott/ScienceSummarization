e surface generation systems will be told to generate a phrase for the attribute set { $city-to, $time-dep }.
    The output of NLG3 on the attribute set { $city-to, $city-fr, $time-dep } is shown in Table 9.
    There does not appear to be an objective automatic evaluation method2 for generated text that correlates with how an actual person might judge the output.
    Therefore, two judges &#8212; the author and a colleague &#8212; manually evaluated the output of all three systems.
    Each judge assigned each phrase from each of the three systems one of the following rankings: OK: Tense or agreement is wrong, but word choice is correct.
    (These errors could be corrected by post-processing with a morphological analyzer.)
    Bad: Words are missing or extraneous words are present No Output: The system failed to produce any output While there were a total 1946 attribute sets from the test examples, the judges only needed to evaluate the 190 unique attribute sets, e.g., the attribute set { $city-fr $city-to
