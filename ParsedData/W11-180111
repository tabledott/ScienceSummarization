omparable (GEp vs EPIp), with the small drop for the EPI result, suggesting that the removal of the GE domain specificity does not compromise extraction performance.
    EPIc results indicate some challenges in generalization to similar event types, and EPIf suggest substantial further challenges in additional argument extraction.
    The complexity of ID is comparable to GE, also reflected to their final results, which further indicate successful generalization to a new subject domain as well as to new argument (entity) types.
    The BB task is in part comparable to GEl and involves a representation similar to REL, with lower results likely in part because BB requires entity recognition.
    The BI task is comparable to LLL Challenge, though BI involves more entity and event types.
    The BI result is 20 points above the LLL best result, indicating a substantial progress of the community in five years.
