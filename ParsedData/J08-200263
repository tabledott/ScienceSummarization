OCAL model.
    This shows that even though the local model is optimized to use a large set of features and achieve state-of-the-art performance, it is still advantageous to model the joint information in the sequence of labels in a predicate&#8217;s argument frame.
    Additionally, the joint syntactic&#8211;semantic features improved performance further, showing that when predicting the label of an argument, it is useful to condition on the features of other arguments, in addition to their labels.
    A more detailed analysis of the results obtained by the joint model ALLJOINT is given in Figure 11(a) (Summary results), and the two confusion matrices in Figures 11(b) and 11(c), which display the number of errors of each type that the model made.
    The first confusion matrix concentrates on CORE arguments and merges all modifying argument labels into a single ARGM label.
    The second confusion matrix concentrates on confusions among modifying arguments.
    This figure can be compared to Figure 7, which
