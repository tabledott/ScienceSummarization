side cost Q(v) and the Viterbi outside cost a(v) for each node v, and then compute the merit aQ(e) for each hyperedge: Intuitively, this merit is the cost of the best derivation that traverses e, and the difference S(e) = aQ(e) &#8722; Q(TOP) can be seen as the distance away from the globally best derivation.
    We prune away all hyperedges that have S(e) &gt; p for a threshold p. Nodes with all incoming hyperedges pruned are also pruned.
    The key difference from (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) is that in this algorithm, a node can &#8220;partially&#8221; survive the beam, with a subset of its hyperedges pruned.
    In practice, this method prunes on average 15% more hyperedges than their method.
  
  
    We compare the performance of our forest reranker against n-best reranking on the Penn English Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
    The baseline parser is the Charniak parser, which we modified to output a packed forest for each sentence.3 We use the standard split of the Treebank: sections 02-21 as the tra
