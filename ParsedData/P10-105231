ions and allows to design innovative training strategies, such as the one presented in section 5.4.
    This package is released as open-source software and is available at http://wapiti.limsi.fr.
    In the future, we intend to study how sparsity can be used to speed-up training in the face of more complex dependency patterns (such as higher-order CRFs or hierarchical dependency structures (Rozenknop, 2002; Finkel et al., 2008).
    From a performance point of view, it might also be interesting to combine the use of large-scale feature sets with other recent improvements such as the use of semi-supervised learning techniques (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) or variable-length dependencies (Qian et al., 2009).
