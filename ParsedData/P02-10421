re tree using simple head percolation heuristics.
    This approach does not work well for the long-range dependencies involved in raising, control, extraction and coordination, all of which are common in text such as the Wall Street Journal.
    Chiang (2000) uses Tree Adjoining Grammar as an alternative to context-free grammar, and here we use another &#8220;mildly context-sensitive&#8221; formalism, Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, Steedman (2000)), which arguably provides the most linguistically satisfactory account of the dependencies inherent in coordinate constructions and extraction phenomena.
    The potential advantage from using such an expressive grammar is to facilitate recovery of such unbounded dependencies.
    As well as having a potential impact on the accuracy of the parser, recovering such dependencies may make the output more useful.
    CCG is unlike other formalisms in that the standard predicate-argument relations relevant to interpretation can be derived via extremely non-standard
