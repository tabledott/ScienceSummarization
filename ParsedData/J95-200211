  This analogy will be explored further in the probabilistic formulation later on.
    The three types of transitions operate as follows.
    Prediction.
    For each state
  
  
    where Y is a nonterminal anywhere in the RHS, and for all rules Y v expanding Y, add states i: jY&#8212;.v.
    A state produced by prediction is called a predicted state.
    Each prediction corresponds to a potential expansion of a nonterminal in a left-most derivation. where a is a terminal symbol that matches the current input x1, add the state (move the dot over the current symbol).
    A state produced by scanning is called a scanned state.
    Scanning ensures that the terminals produced in a derivation match the input string.
    Completion.
    For each complete state (move the dot over the current nonterminal).
    A state produced by completion is called a completed state.'
    Each completion corresponds to the end of a nonterminal expansion started by a matching prediction step.
    For each input symbol and correspo
