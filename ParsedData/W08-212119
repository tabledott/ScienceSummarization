    For instance, to find the head of an S phrase, we look from right to left for a VP.
    If no VP is found, look for anything with a PRD function tag, and so on.
    Moreover, since the grammatical structure inSet the function tag of C to L procedure infer-function(C) let c be the head of C, P the parent of C, and p the head of P side noun phrases (NP) is under-specified in the Penn Treebank, we imported dependencies inside NPs and hyphenated words from a version of the Penn Treebank mapped into GLARF, the Grammatical and Logical Argument Representation Framework (Meyers et al., 2007).
