    Also, both &amp;quot; hwjz&amp;quot; and 13...4 hywzn occur in our corpus as possible transliterations for Hughes (both occurred as a transliteration for Karen Hughes).
    To back-transliterate such instances, one would need to consider spelling-based mappings not just sound mappings.
    To address these limitations, we propose a new spelling-based model that can be used alone or in conjunction with the phonetic-based model.
    The new model outperforms the phonetic-based model, even when evaluated on names found in the phonetic dictionary as we will discuss in more detail in Section 8.
    The spelling-based model we propose directly maps English letter sequences into Arabic letter sequences with probability P(alw), which is trained on an English/Arabic name list without the need for English pronunciations.
    Since no pronunciations are needed, this list is easily obtainable for many language pairs.
    We also extend the model P(w) to include a letter trigram model in add
