   Some basic constructions of the Japanese grammar were described.
    As the grammar is aimed at working in applications with real-world data, performance and robustness issues are important.
    The grammar is being developed in a multilingual context, where much value is placed on parallel and consistent semantic representations.
    The development of this grammar constitutes an important test of the cross-linguistic validity of the MRS formalism.
    The evaluation shows that the grammar is at a stage where domain adaptation is possible in a reasonable amount of time.
    Thus, it is a powerful resource for linguistic applications for Japanese.
    In future work, this grammar could be further adapted to another domain, such as the EDR newspaper corpus (including a headline grammar).
    As each new domain is approached, we anticipate that the adaptation will become easier as resources from earlier domains are reused.
    Initial evaluation of the grammar on new domains and the growth curve of grammar c
