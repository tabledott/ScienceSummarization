seil&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;conservative&amp;quot; is only 6/12.
    The only remaining question was what minimum LCSR value should indicate that two words are cognates.
    This question was easy to answer using BiBLE.
    BiBLE scores were maximized for lexicons using the Cognate Filter when a LCSR cut-off of 0.58 was used.
    The Wilcoxon signed ranks test found the difference between BiBLE scores for lexicons produced with this LCSR cut-off and for lexicons produced with the criterion used in [Sim92] to be statistically significant at a = 0.01.
    The longest common subsequence between two words can be computed as a special case of their edit distance, in time proportional to the product of their lengths[Wag74].3 Languages with a similar syntax tend to express ideas in similar order.
    The translation of a word occurring at the end of a French sentence is likely to occur towards the end of the English translation.
    In general, lines drawn between corresponding lexemes in a French sentence and its
