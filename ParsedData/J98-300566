ision making (e.g., deciding whether the same organization has been involved in multiple incidents).
    The time for decision making will be plotted against the accuracy of the answers provided by the judges from the two sets.
    A third set of judges might have access to summaries generated by summarizers based on sentence extraction from multiple documents.
    Similar evaluation techniques have been proposed for singledocument summarizers (Jing et al. 1998).
  
  
    The prototype system that we have developed serves as the springboard for research in a variety of directions.
    First and foremost is the need to use statistical techniques to increase the robustness and vocabulary of the system.
    Since we were looking for phrasings that mark summarization in a full article that includes other material as well, for a first pass we found it necessary to do a manual analysis in order to determine which phrases were used for summarization.
    In other words, we knew of no automatic way of identifying su
