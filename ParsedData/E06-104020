ing (327 instances) are more common than by midnight (184 instances).
    However, forecast readers dislike this use of later (because later is used to mean something else in a different type of forecast), and also dislike variants of by evening, because they are unsure how to interpret them (Reiter et al., 2005); this is why SUMTIME uses by midnight.
    The SUMTIME system builders believe deviating from corpus frequency in such cases makes SUMTIME texts better from the reader&#8217;s perspective, and it does appear to increase human ratings of the system; but deviating from the corpus in such a way decreases the system&#8217;s score under corpus-similarity metrics.
    In other words, judging the output of an NLG system by comparing it to corpus texts by a method that rewards corpus similarity will penalise systems which do not base choice on highest frequency of occurrence in the corpus, even if this is motivated by careful studies of what is best for text readers.
