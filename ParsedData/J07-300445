is simply a placeholder for a bindable argument, like the relational grammarians&#8217; ch&#710;omeur relation.
    15 Extractions such as Who was he paid by require the by-PP to be treated as an argument, and it would in fact be better to use a lexical rule to generate (S[pss]\NP)/PP[by] from S[pss]\NP and vice versa.
    Infinitival and Participial VPs, Gerunds.
    In the Treebank, participial phrases, gerunds, imperatives, and to-VP arguments are annotated as sentences with a &#8727; null subject: We treat these like verb phrases (S\NP) with the appropriate feature ([b], [to], [ng], or [pt]), depending on the part-of-speech tag of the verb.
    Control and Raising.
    CCGbank does not distinguish between control and raising.
    In the Treebank, subject-control and subject-raising verbs (e.g., want and seem) also take an S complement with a null subject that is coindexed with the subject of the main clause: We ignore the coindexation in the Treebank, and treat all control verbs as non-arbitrary control.
