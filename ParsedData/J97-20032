tural to linguists (Gross 1989).
    Graphic tools also allow one to visualize and modify automata, which helps in correcting and completing a grammar.
    Other more general phenomena, such as parsing context-free grammars, can also be dealt with using finitestate machines such as RTN's (Woods 1970).
    Moreover, the underlying mechanisms in most of the methods used in parsing are related to automata.
    From the computational point of view, the use of finite-state machines is mainly motivated by considerations of time and space efficiency.
    Time efficiency is usually achieved using deterministic automata.
    The output of deterministic machines depends, in general linearly, only on the input size and can therefore be considered optimal from this point of view.
    Space efficiency is achieved with classical minimization algorithms (Aho, Hoperoft, and Ullman 1974) for deterministic automata.
    Applications such as compiler construction have shown deterministic finite automata to be very efficient in
