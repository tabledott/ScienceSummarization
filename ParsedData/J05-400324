rocess by computing precision and recall.
    Precision is the ratio of sentence pairs correctly judged as parallel to the total number of pairs judged as parallel by the classifier.
    Recall is the ratio of sentence pairs correctly identified as parallel by the classifier to the total number of truly parallel pairs&#8212;i.e., the number of pairs in the parallel corpus used to generate the test instances.
    Both numbers are expressed as percentages.
    More formally: let classified parallel be the total number of sentence pairs from our test set that the classifier judged as parallel, classified well be the number of pairs that the classifier correctly judged as parallel, and true parallel be the total number of parallel pairs in the test set.
    Then: classified parallel true parallel There are two factors that influence a classifier&#8217;s performance: dictionary coverage and similarity between the domains of the training and test instances.
