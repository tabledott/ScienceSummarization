nowing what they are, i.e., I (comman(A, B)) = I (describe(A.
    B)).
    Therefore, the function f must have the following property: Vx, f (x, x) = 1.
    Assumption 7: The function f (x. y) is continuous.
    Similarity Theorem: The similarity between A and B is measured by the ratio between the amount of information needed to state the commonality of A and B and the information needed to fully describe what A and B are: Proof: To prove the theorem. we need to show f(x,y) = s. Since f(x,y) = f(s.1) (due to Assumption 4), we only need to show that when LI, is a rational number, f (x,y) = .
    The result can be generalized to all real numbers because f is continuous and for any real number, there are rational numbers that are infinitely close to it.
    Suppose m and n are positive integers.
    (due to Assumption 5).
    Thus. f (x, y) = ;-; f (nx, y).
    Substituting fi for x in this equation: Q.E.D.
    For example.
