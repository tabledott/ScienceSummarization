or both the overall and L.&#172;app set performance of all three tasks.
    Table 6 shows the relation between JESS-CM performance and U.app in the NER experiments.
    The development data and test data were obtained from 30-31 Aug. 1996 and 6-7 Dec. 1996 Reuters news articles, respectively.
    We find that temporal proximity leads to better performance.
    This aspect can also be explained as U.app.
    Basically, the U.app increase leads to improved performance.
    The evidence provided by the above experiments implies that increasing the coverage of unlabeled data offers the strong possibility of increasing the expected performance of unseen data.
    Thus, it strongly encourages us to use an SSL approach that includes JESS-CM to construct a general tagger and chunker for actual use.
  
  
    In POS tagging, the previous best performance was reported by (Shen et al., 2007) as summarized in Table 7.
    Their method uses a novel sophisticated model that learns both decoding order and labeling, while ou
