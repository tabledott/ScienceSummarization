as recovered as a member of the occurring set.
    Otherwise, it was recovered as a member of the non-occurring set.
    Out of the 150 pairs of the occurring set, our method correctly identified 119 (79%).
    For the non-occurring set, it correctly identified 126 pairs (84%).
    Thus, the method achieved an overall accuracy of 81.6%.
    Optimal tuning of the threshold, to a value of 2, improves the overall accuracy to 85%, where about 90% of the members of the occurring set and 80% of those in the non-occurring set are identified correctly.
    This is contrasted with the optimal discrimination that could be achieved by frequency based estimation, which is 58%.
    Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the results of the experiment.
    Figure 3 shows the distributions of the expected frequency of the pairs in the two sets, using similarity based and frequency based estimation.
    It clearly indicates that the similarity based method gives high estimates mainly to members of the occurring set and low estimates main
