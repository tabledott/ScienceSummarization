formance by an entity-constrained mention F-measure (henceforth &#8220;ECM-F&#8221;).
    The metric For the mention-pair model, training events are generated for all compatible mention-pairs, which results in about events, about of which are positive examples.
    The full mention-pair model uses about features; Most are conjunction features.
    For the entity-mention model, events are generated by walking through the Bell tree.
    Only events on the true path (i.e., positive examples) and branches emitting from a node on the true path to a node not on the true path (i.e., negative examples) are generated.
    For example, in Figure 1, suppose that the path (a)-(b2)-(c4) is the truth, then positive training examples are starting event from (a) to (b2) and linking event from (b2) to (c4); While the negative examples are linking events from (a) to (b1), (b2) to (c3), and the starting event from (b2) to (c5).
    This scheme generates about events, out of which about are positive training examples.
