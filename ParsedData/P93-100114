 However, the diagonal line running through the upper&#8212;right quadrant is very important.
    This line indicates how the two texts should be aligned.
    Figure 10 shows the upper&#8212;right quadrant of Figure 9, enhanced by standard signal processing techniques (e.g., low&#8212;pass filtering and thresholding).
    The diagonal line in Figure 10 is almost straight, but not quite.
    The minor deviations in this line are crucial for determining the alignment of the two texts.
    Figures 11 and 12 make it easier to see these deviations by first rotating the image and increasing the vertical resolution by an order of magnitude.
    The alignment program makes use of both of these transformation in order to track the alignment path with as much precision as possible.
    It is difficult to know in advance how much dynamic range to set aside for the vertical axis.
    Setting the range too high wastes memory, and setting it too low causes the signal to be clipped.
    We use an iterative solution to find
