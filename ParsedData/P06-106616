t1 to denote the first word of the target t. Lexical features are defined on the single word s1 or t1.
    Collocation features are defined on the combination s1 or t1 between two blocks b1 and b2.
    Three kinds of combinations are used.
    The first one is source collocation, b1.s1&amp;b2.s1.
    The second is target collocation, b1.t1&amp;b2.t1.
    The last one (',) l 0, otherwise plates.
    The first one is a lexical feature, and the second one is a target collocation feature, where Ei are English words, O E {straight, inverted}. is block collocation, b1.s1&amp;b1.t1 and b2.s1&amp;b2.t1.
    The templates for the lexical feature and the collocation feature are shown in Figure 3.
    Why do we use the first words as features?
    These words are nicely at the boundary of blocks.
    One of assumptions of phrase-based SMT is that phrase cohere across two languages (Fox, 2002), which means phrases in one language tend to be moved together during translation.
    This indicates that boundary words of bloc
