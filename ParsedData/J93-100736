ollocations are not of interest for our purpose, although they could be useful for disambiguation or other semantic purposes.
    Condition (C2) filters out exactly this type of collocations. pi, ?pi + (ki x iff,) (c3) Condition (C3) pulls out the interesting relative positions of the two words.
    Conditions (C2) and (C1) eliminate rows in the output of Step 1.2.
    (See Figure 2).
    In contrast, Condition (C3) selects columns from the remaining rows.
    For each pair of words, one or several positions might be favored and thus result in several /9'1 selected.
    For example, the pair &amp;quot;expensive-takeover&amp;quot; produced two different peaks, one with only one word in between &amp;quot;expensive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;takeover,&amp;quot; and the other with two words.
    Example sentences containing the two words in the two possible positions are: &amp;quot; The provision is aimed at making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive by enabling Borg Warner's stockholders to buy the .
