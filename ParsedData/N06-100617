cal classifier described above operates.
    These features try to capture salient patterns of entailment and non-entailment, with particular attention to contexts which reverse or block monotonicity, such as negations and quantifiers.
    This section describes the most important groups of features.
    Polarity features.
    These features capture the presence (or absence) of linguistic markers of negative polarity contexts in both the text and the hypothesis, such as simple negation (not), downward-monotone quantifiers (no, few), restricting prepositions (without, except) and superlatives (tallest).
    Adjunct features.
    These indicate the dropping or adding of syntactic adjuncts when moving from the text to the hypothesis.
    For the common case of restrictive adjuncts, dropping an adjunct preserves truth (Dogs barked loudly &#65533;= Dogs barked), while adding an adjunct does not (Dogs barked K Dogs barked today).
    However, in negative-polarity contexts (such as No dogs barked), this heuristic is
