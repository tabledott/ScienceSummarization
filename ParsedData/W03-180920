semantic class to form a corpusattested VPC; WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) was used as the source for verb substitution candidates, and a hand-build semantic taxonomy for particles.
    The second technique explored the semantic similarity of a VPC to its component verb by comparing their subcategorisation preferences, assuming that semantic similarity between a VPC and its component verb indicates compositionality.
    Poor results were put down to data-sparseness, and the lexical resources not being well suited to the task.
    We use a larger corpus and an automatically-derived thesaurus for the research described in this paper, with the hope of overcoming these problems.
    McCarthy et al. (2003) carry out research close in spirit to that described here, in taking VPC tokens automatically extracted from the BNC and using an automatically acquired thesaurus to classify their relative compositionality.
    One significant divergence from our research is that they consider compositionality to be an indivisi
