Smeaton and Quigley, 1996), retrieval on a small collection of image captions - that is, on very short documents - is reasonably improved using measures of conceptual distance between words based on WordNet 1.4.
    Previously, captions and queries had been manually disambiguated against WordNet.
    The reason for such success is that with very short documents (e.g. boys playing in the sand) the chance of finding the original terms of the query (e.g. of children running on a beach) are much lower than for average-size documents (that typically include many phrasings for the same concepts).
    These results are in agreement with (Voorhees, 1994), but it remains the question of whether the conceptual distance matching would scale up to longer documents and queries.
    In addition, the experiments in _ (Smeaton and Quigley, 1996) only consider nouns, while WordNet offers the chance to use all open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs).
