em x in bucket B, V&lt;g(x,B): Intuitively, as g increases, for x E B, inner&lt;g(x,B) becomes closer and closer to inner(x).
    That is, the finite sum of values in the former approaches the infinite sum of values in the latter.
    For w-continuous semirings (which includes all of the semirings considered in this paper), an infinite sum is equal to the supremum of the partial sums (Kuich 1997, 613).
    Thus, It will be easier to compute the supremum if we find a simple formula for V&lt;g(x,B).
    Notice that for items x e B, there will be no generation 0 derivations, so V&lt;0(x, B) = 0.
    Thus, generation 0 makes a trivial base for a recursive formula.
    Now, we can consider the general case: Theorem 3 For x an item in a looping bucket B, and for g &gt; 1, The proof parallels that of Theorem 2 (Goodman 1998).
    A formula for V&lt;g(x,B) is useful, but what we really need is specific techniques for computing the supremum, V(x) = supg V&lt;g(x,B).
    For all w-continuous semirings, the supremum of
