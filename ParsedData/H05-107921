			Thus, there is a correspondence be tween low word overlap and FALSE examples (see Example 731 in the Introduction, where important words in the hypothesis like ?swamps?

			are not matched in the text); high overlap, however, is normally necessary but not sufficient for TRUE entailment (see also Example 78 in Section 3).Experiment 3: Strict entailment To test the potential of entailment as discovered by theorem prov ing alone, we now use only the entailment and inconsistent features.
			As to be expected, the decision tree shows that, if a proof for T implies H has been found, the
