rding to a set of models that are combined in a log-linear framework as in (Och, 03).
    This approach offers the following advantages over string-based SMT systems: Instead of limiting learned phrases to contiguous word sequences, we allow translation by all possible phrases that form connected subgraphs (treelets) in the source and target dependency trees.
    This is a powerful extension: the vast majority of surface-contiguous phrases are also treelets of the tree; in addition, we gain discontiguous phrases, including combinations such as verb-object, article-noun, adjective-noun etc. regardless of the number of intervening words.
    Another major advantage is the ability to employ more powerful models for reordering source language constituents.
    These models can incorporate information from the source analysis.
    For example, we may model directly the probability that the translation of an object of a preposition in English should precede the corresponding postposition in Japanese, or the probabi
