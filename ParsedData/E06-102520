ly to have an &#8220;objective&#8221; nature, and that hyponyms (and also synonyms and antonyms) of an objective term are also objective.
    Note that, at each iteration k, a given term t is added to Trko only if it does not already belong to either Trp or Trn.
    We experiment with two different choices for the Tro set, corresponding to the sets generated in K = 3 and K = 4 iterations, respectively; this yields sets Tr3o and Tr4o consisting of 8,353 and 33,870 training terms, respectively.
    We experiment with three &#8220;philosophically&#8221; different learning approaches to the problem of distinguishing between Positive, Negative, and Objective terms.
    Approach I is a two-stage method which consists in learning two binary classifiers: the first classifier places terms into either Subjective or Objective, while the second classifier places terms that have been classified as Subjective by the first classifier into either Positive or Negative.
    In the training phase, the terms in TrKp &#8746; TrKn
