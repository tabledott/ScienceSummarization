idate suffixes if they appear with at least two stems of length 5.
    His first task is (in our terms) to infer paradigms from signatures (see Section 9), which is to say, to find appropriate clusters of signatures.
    One example cited is depart, departure, departer.
    He used a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method, which begins with all signatures forming distinct clusters, and successively collapses the two most similar clusters, where similarity between stems is defined as the number of suffixes that two stems share, and similarity between clusters is defined as the similarity between the two least similar stems in the respective clusters.
    He reports a success rate of 77%, but it is not clear how to evaluate this figure.'
    The task that Gaussier addresses is defined from the start to be that of derivational morphology, and because of that, his analysis does not need to address the problem of inflectional morphology, but it is there (front and center, so to speak) that the difficult clus
