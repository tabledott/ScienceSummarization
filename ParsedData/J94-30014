cal would be realized as in practical and iNpractical as well as impractical, and the abstract N would not necessarily be removed from iNtractable.
    Ordering the rules means that the output of the first is taken as the input to the second.
    This prevents iNpractical from being converted to in practical by Rule 2 without first considering Rule 1.
    These obligatory rules always produce exactly one result from a given input.
    This is not the case when they are made to operate in the reverse direction.
    For example, if Rule 2 is inverted on the string intractable, there will be two results, intractable and iNtractable.
    This is because intractable is derivable by that rule from both of these strings.
    Of course, only the segments in iNtractable will eventually match against the lexicon, but in general both the N and n results of this inversion can figure in valid interpretations.
    Compare the words undecipherable and indecipherable.
    The n in the prefix un-, unlike the one in in-, does
