    In the idea domain, ideas are mapped to objects, minds are mapped to locations, and communications are mapped to paths.
    Axioms of inference from the target domain usually become available for reasoning about the source domain, unless there is an aspect of the source domain that specifically contradicts them.
    For instance, in the domain of material objects, a thing moved from point X to point Y is no longer at X, but in the idea domain, it exists at both locations.
    Thematically related metaphors may consistently co-occur in the same sentences.

    Conversely, cooccurring metaphors are often components of a single metaphorical conceptualization.
