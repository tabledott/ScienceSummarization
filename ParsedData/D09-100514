ance as t/Z &#8722; (r/Z)2, which is why we may call our second-order expectation semiring the variance semiring.
    To prove our claim about the first-order expectation semiring, we first observe that the definitions in Table 1 satisfy the semiring axioms.
    The reader can easily check these axioms (as well as the closure axioms in footnote 2).
    With a valid semiring, we then simply observe that Figure 2 returns the total weight &#174;dED &#174;eEd ke = &#174;dED (p(d), p(d)r(d)) = (Z, r).
    It is easy to verify the second equality from the definitions of &#174;, Z, and r. The first equality requires proving that &#174;eEd ke = (p(d), p(d)r(d)) from the definitions of &#174;, ke, p(d), and r(d).
    The main intuition is that &#174; can be used to build up (p(d), p(d)r(d)) inductively from the ke: if d decomposes into two disjoint subderivations d1, d2, then (p(d), p(d)r(d)) = (p(d1)p(d2),p(d1)p(d2)(r(d1) + r(d2))) = (p(d1),p(d1)r(d1)) &#174; (p(d2),p(d2)r(d2)).
    The base cases are where d is a si
