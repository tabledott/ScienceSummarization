  Machine Transliteration
  
    It is challenging to translate names and technical terms across languages with different alphabets and sound inventories.
    These items are commonly transliterated, i.e., replaced with approximate phonetic equivalents. example, English comes out :/ &#8212; in Japanese.
    Translating such items from Japanese back to English is even more challenging, and of practical interest, as transliterated items make up the bulk of text phrases not found in bilingual dictionaries.
    We describe and evaluate a method for performing backwards transliterations by machine.
    This method uses a generative model, incorporating several distinct stages in the transliteration process.
  
  
    Translators must deal with many problems, and one of the most frequent is translating proper names and technical terms.
    For language pairs like Spanish/English, this presents no great challenge: a phrase like Antonio Gil usually gets translated as Antonio Gil.
    However, the situation is more c
