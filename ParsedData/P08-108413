ons A, E, and F. These three distributions are drawn from three separate Dirichlet processes, each with appropriately defined base distributions.
    The Dirichlet processes ensure that the resulting distributions concentrate their probability mass on a small number of morphemes while holding out reasonable probability for unseen possibilities.
    Once A, E, and F have been drawn, we model our parallel corpus of short phrases as a series of independent draws from a phrase-pair generation model.
    For each new phrase-pair, the model first chooses the number and type of morphemes to be generated.
    In particular, it must choose how many unaligned stray morphemes from language &#163;, unaligned stray morphemes from language F, and abstract morphemes are to compose the parallel phrases.
    These three numbers, respectively denoted as m, n, and k, are drawn from a Poisson distribution.
    This step is illustrated in Figure 1 part (a).
    The model then proceeds to independently draw m language &#163; morph
