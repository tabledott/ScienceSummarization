    We determined the distributions, Pr (4) and Pr (ii), front the relative frequencies of various sentence lengths in our data.
    Figure 4 shows for each language a histogram of these for sentences with fewer than 81 tokens.
    Except for lengths 2 and 4, which include a large number of formulaic sentences in both the French and the English, the distributions are very smooth.
    For short sentences, the relative frequency is a reliable estimate of the corresponding probability since for both French and English we have more than 100 sentences of each length less than 81.
    We estimated the probabilities
  
  
    of greater lengths by fitting the observed frequencies of longer sentences to the tail of a Poisson distribution.
    We determined all of the other parameters by applying the EM algorithm to a large sample of text [Baum, 1972, Dempster et al., 1977].
    The resulting values are shown in Table 3.
    From these parameters, we can see that 91% of the English sentences and 98% of the Engli
