the right tree structure analysis of various linguistic constructions ought to be.
    Figure 1 shows some of the variation in PP modification structures postulated in generative syntactic approaches over the past 30 years.
    The flat attachment structure was popular in the early days of transformational grammar, and is used to represent VPs in the WSJ corpus.
    In this representation both arguments and adjuncts are sisters to the lexical head, and so are not directly distinguished in the tree structure.
    The adjunction representation was introduced by Chomsky (it is often called &amp;quot;Chomsky adjunction&amp;quot;); in that representation arguments are sisters to the lexical head, while adjuncts are adjoined as sisters to a phrasal node: either a maximal projection (as shown in Figure 1) or a &amp;quot;1-bar&amp;quot; projection in the &amp;quot;X-bar&amp;quot; theory of grammar and its descendants.
    The third representation depicted in Figure 1 is a mixed representation in which phrases with ad
