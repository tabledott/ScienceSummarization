ference.
    These rules are used as expectation constraints on the posterior distribution over dependency structures.
    This approach is based on the posterior regularization technique (Grac&#184;a et al., 2009), which we apply to a variational inference algorithm for our parsing model.
    Our model can also optionally refine common high-level syntactic categories into per-language categories by inducing a clustering of words using Dirichlet Processes (Ferguson, 1973).
    Since the universals guide induction toward linguistically plausible structures, automatic refinement becomes feasible even in the absence of manually annotated syntactic trees.
    We test the effectiveness of our grammar induction model on six Indo-European languages from three language groups: English, Danish, Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish.
    Though these languages share a high-level Indo-European ancestry, they cover a diverse range of syntactic phenomenon.
    Our results demonstrate that universal rules greatly impro
