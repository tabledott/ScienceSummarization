ntil we have seen more of the string.
    In effect, this is an underspecification of some of the predictions that our top-down parser is making about the rest of the string.
    The leftfactorization transform that we use is identical to what is called right binarization in Roark and Johnson (1999).
    See that paper for more discussion of the benefits of Two parse trees: (a) a complete left-factored parse tree with epsilon productions and an explicit stop symbol; and (b) a partial left-factored parse tree. factorization for top-down and left-corner parsing.
    For a grammar G, we define a factored grammar Gf as follows: We can see the effect of this transform on our example parse trees in Figure 2.
    This underspecification of the nonterminal predictions (e.g., VP-VBD in the example in Figure 2, as opposed to NP), allows lexical items to become part of the left context, and so be used to condition production probabilities, even the production probabilities of constituents that dominate them in the unfac
