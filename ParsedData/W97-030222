arsing can be seen as an approximation to an admissible technique, where the degree of approximation is controlled by the thresholding parameter.
  
  
    The use of any one of these techniques does not exclude the use of the others.
    There is no reason that we cannot use beam thresholding, global thresholding, and multiple-pass parsing all at the same time.
    In general, it wouldn't make sense to use a technique such as multiple-pass parsing without other thresholding techniques; our first pass would be overwhelmingly slow without some sort of thresholding.
    There are, however, some practical considerations.
    To optimize a single threshold, we could simply sweep our parameters over a one dimensional range, and pick the best speed versus performance tradeoff.
    In combining multiple techniques, we need to find optimal combinations of thresholding parameters.
    Rather than having to examine 10 values in a single dimensional space, we might have to examine 100 combinations in a two dimensional s
