smatches betweenSenseval data and parallel corpora.
			But most importantly, this allows WSD training data to be gener ated entirely automatically, since the parallel corpus is automatically phrase-aligned in order to learn the SMT phrase bilexicon.
			4.4 The WSD system.
			The word sense disambiguation subsystem is mod eled after the best performing WSD system in the Chinese lexical sample task at Senseval-3 (Carpuat et al, 2004).
			The features employed are typical of WSD and are therefore far richer than those used in mostSMT systems.
			The feature set consists of positionsensitive, syntactic, and local collocational fea tures, since these features yielded the best results when combined in a na??ve Bayes model on severalSenseval-2 lexical sample tasks (Yarowsky and Flo rian, 2002).
			These features scale easily to the bigger vocabulary and sense candidates to be considered in a SMT task.
			The Senseval system consists of an ensemble of four combined WSD models: The first model is a na??ve Bayes model,
