s are always above the binary baseline, whereas only the SP-EN average result is higher than the multiclass baseline(0.44 vs. 0.43).
    To better understand the behaviour of each system (also in relation to the different language combinations), Table 4 provides separate precision, recall, and F1 scores for each entailment judgment, calculated over the best runs of each participating team.
    Overall, the results suggest that the &#8220;bidirectional&#8221; and &#8220;no entailment&#8221; categories are more problematic than &#8220;forward&#8221; and &#8220;backward&#8221; judgments.
    For most datasets, in fact, systems&#8217; performance on &#8220;bidirectional&#8221; and &#8220;no entailment&#8221; is significantly lower, typically on recall.
    Except for the DE-EN dataset (more problematic on &#8220;forward&#8221;), also average F1 results on these judgments are lower.
    This might be due to the fact that, for all datasets, the vast majority of &#8220;bidirectional&#8221; and &#8220;no entailment&#
