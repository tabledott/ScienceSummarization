pair, accept it if it does not cross any previously accepted phrase pair; otherwise, reject it.
    Because this heuristic produces a set of nesting phrases, we can represent them all in a single restructured tree.
    In Figure 4, this heuristic chooses structure (a) because the English-side counterpart of IP/VP has the simple category NP.
  
  
    In decoding, the rules extracted during training must be reassembled to form a derivation whose source side matches the input sentence.
    In the exact tree-to-tree approach, whenever substitution is performed, the root labels of the substituted trees must match the labels of the substitution nodes&#8212;call this the matching constraint.
    Because this constraint must be satisfied on both the source and target side, it can become difficult to generalize well from training examples to new input sentences.
    Venugopal et al. (2009), in the string-to-tree setting, attempt to soften the data-fragmentation effect of the matching constraint: instead of trying to
