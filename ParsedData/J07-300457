ys the case.
    This is unfortunate, because CCG is particularly suited for this construction.
    However, we believe that it would be easier to manually reannotate those sentences that are not at present translated than to try to adapt the algorithm to deal with all of them individually.
    (PP-CLR=2 to the general manager))) This construction cannot be handled with the standard combinatory rules of CCG that are assumed for English.
    Instead, Steedman (2000) proposes an analysis of gapping that uses a unification-based &#8220;decomposition&#8221; rule.
    Categorial decomposition allows a category type to be split apart into two subparts, and is used to yield an analysis of gapping that is very similar to that of argument cluster coordination:22 22 It is only the syntactic types that are decomposed or recovered in this way: the corresponding semantic entities and in particular the interpretation for the gapped verb group can talk must be available from the left conjunct&#8217;s information structure,
