rds to one of the main aspects of semantics in natural language: compositionality.
    To be fair, the study of semantic compositionality in DSMs has seen a slight revival in the recent times, cf.
    Widdows (2008), Mitchell &amp; Lapata (2008), Giesbrecht (2009), Baroni &amp; Lenci (2009), who propose various DSM approaches to represent argument structure, subject-verb and verb-object co-selection.
    Current approaches to compositionality in DSMs are based on the application of a simple geometric operation on the basis of individual vectors (vector addition, pointwisemultiplication of corresponding dimensions, tensor product) which should in principle approximate the composition of any two given vectors.
    On the contrary, since the the very nature of compositionality depends on the semantic relation being instantiated in a syntactic structure, we propose that the composition of vector representations must be modelled as a relation-specific phenomenon.
    In particular, we propose that the usual proced
