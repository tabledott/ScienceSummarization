the table, row &#8220;Peng&#8221; represents the CRF model from Peng et al. (2004), and the last row represents our model.
    The first three columns represent tests with the AS, CU and PU corpora, respectively.
    The best score in each column is shown in bold.
    The last two columns represent the average accuracy of each model over the tests it participated in (SAV), and our average over the same tests (OAV), respectively.
    For each row the best average is shown in bold.
    We achieved the best accuracy in two of the three corpora, and better overall accuracy than the majority of the other models.
    The average score of S10 is 0.7% higher than our model, but S10 only participated in the HK test.
    Four training and testing corpora were used in the second bakeoff (Emerson, 2005), including the Academia Sinica corpus (AS), the Hong Kong City University Corpus (CU), the Peking University Corpus (PK) and the Microsoft Research Corpus (MR) .
