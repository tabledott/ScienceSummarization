ucer can be constructed that performs exactly this transduction without incorporating any analog of the intermediate tape.
    In short, the relations accepted by finite-state transducers are closed under serial composition.
    Figure 4 shows the composition of the m-machine in Figure 3 and the n-machine in Figure 2.
    This transducer models the cascade in which the output of Rule 1 is the input to Rule 2.
    This machine is constructed so that it encodes all the possible ways in which the m-machine and n-machine could interact through a common tape.
    The only interesting interactions involve N, and these are summarized in the following table: input m-machine output input n-machine output N labial follows m Tri N nonlabial follows N n An N in the input to the m-machine is converted to m before a labial and this m remains unchanged by the n-machine.
    The only instances of N that reach the n-machine must therefore be followed by nonlabials and these must be converted to n. Accordingly, after convertin
