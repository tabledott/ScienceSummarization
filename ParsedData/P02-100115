ring the E step, we restrict to paths compatible with this observation by computing xi o f&#952; o yi, shown in Fig.
    2.
    To find each path&#8217;s posterior probability given the observation (xi, yi), just conditionalize: divide its raw probability by the total probability (Pz&#65533; 0.1003) of all paths in Fig.
    2.
    11To implement an HMM by an FST, compose a probabilistic FSA that generates a state sequence of the HMM with a conditional FST that transduces HMM states to emitted symbols.
    But that is not the full E step.
    The M step uses not individual path probabilities (Fig.
    2 has infinitely many) but expected counts derived from the paths.
    Crucially, &#167;4 will show how the E step can accumulate these counts effortlessly.
    We first explain their use by the M step, repeating the presentation of &#167;2: in Fig.
    2 is &#8220;really&#8221; to traverse Q a:x Rosenfeld, 1999).12 For globally normalized, joint models, the predicted vector is ecf(E*, A*).
