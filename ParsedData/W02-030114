 set of features for a group g and a position k as gk (e.g., wk and posk).
    Using this notation, we write a feature set as {w&#8722;1, w0, pre&#8722;1, pre0, pc&#8722;1}.4 This feature description derives the following input vector.5 In Section 3.3, we described that if target classes are equally distributed, the pairwise method will reduce the training cost.
    In our case, however, we have a very unbalanced class distribution with a large number of samples belonging to the class &#8220;O&#8221; (see Table 1).
    This leads to the same situation with the one-vsrest method, i.e., if LO is the number of the samples belonging to the class &#8220;O&#8221;, then the most dominant part of the training takes time in K &#215; OSVM(LO).
    One solution to this unbalanced class distribution problem is to split the class &#8220;O&#8221; into several subclasses effectively.
    This will reduce the training cost for the same reason that the pairwise method works.
    In this paper, we propose to split the non-enti
