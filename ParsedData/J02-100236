and FNP1 the most, with FP3 and FNP3 falling in between.
    These results are as expected, for the same reasons as for Pk.
    The difference in the penalty for FP1 and FP3 (and FNP1 vs. FNP3)&#8212;for both Pk and Pk, but especially apparent for Pk&#8212;is interesting.
    In FP/FNP1, false positive probability is uniformly distributed throughout each segment, whereas in FP/FNP3, false positive probability is uniformly distributed throughout the entire document.
    Thus, the FP/FNP3 segmentations are more likely to have boundaries that are very close to each other, since they are not segment dependent, while FP/FNP1 are limited to at most one false positive per segment.
    This results in Pk assigning smaller penalties for FP/FNP3, since groups of false positives close together (to be more exact, within k sentences of each other) would be underpenalized.
    This difference is also present in the Pk results, but is about half for obvious reasons.
    WD penalized FP1 the most and FP3 the least among the
