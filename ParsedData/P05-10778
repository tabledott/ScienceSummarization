fast cosine similarity.
    We implement it as follows: vectors {r0, r1, , rd} each of k dimensions.
    A k dimensional unit random vector, in general, is generated by independently sampling a Gaussian function with mean 0 and variance 1, k number of times.
    Each of the k samples is used to assign one dimension to the random vector.
    We generate a random number from a Gaussian distribution by using Box-Muller transformation (Box and Muller, 1958).
    3.
    For every vector u, we determine its signature by using the function hr(u) (as given by equation 4).
    We can represent the signature of vector u as: u&#65533; = {hr1(u), hr2(u), , hrd(u)}.
    Each vector is thus represented by a set of a bit streams of length d. Steps 2 and 3 takes O(nk) time (We can assume d to be a constant since d &lt;&lt; k). where, p is prime and 0 &lt; a &lt; p , 0 &#8804; b &lt; p, and a and b are chosen at random.
    We apply q different random permutation for every vector (by choosing random values for a and b, q numb
