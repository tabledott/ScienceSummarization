hich are followed in all the graphs shown here: Then the derivation graph obeys the bracketing constraint if and only if it can be drawn, following the conventions, without any edges crossing.1 The example of Figure 7.2 shows this clearly.
    In this figure, the closed path formed by edges 1, 2, 3, and 4 has the same effect as a matching pair of brackets in a bracketed string.
    It is also worth noting that nested rule applications appear in a derivation graph as a configuration like the one depicted in Figure 7.3.

    XGs and Left Extraposition We saw in Figure 4.2 a DCG for (some) relative clauses.
    The XG of Figure 8.1 describes essentially the same language fragment, showing how easy it is to describe left extraposition in an XG.
    In that grammar, the sentence The mouse that the cat chased squeaks. has the derivation graph shown in Figure 8.2.
    The left extraposition implicit in the structure of the sentence is represented in the derivation graph by the application of the rule for 'rel
