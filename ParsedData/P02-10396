on of an English phrase to a foreign phrase at non-terminal tree nodes as if is non-terminal.
    In practice, the phrase lengths (, ) are limited to reduce the model size.
    In our experiment (Section 5), we restricted them as , to avoid pairs of extremely different lengths.
    This formula was obtained by randomly sampling the length of translation pairs.
    See (Yamada, 2002) for details.
  
  
    Our statistical MT system is based on the noisychannel model, so the decoder works in the reverse direction of the channel.
    Given a supposed channel output (e.g., a French or Chinese sentence), it will find the most plausible channel input (an English parse tree) based on the model parameters and the prior probability of the input.
    In the syntax-based model, the decoder&#8217;s task is to find the most plausible English parse tree given an observed foreign sentence.
    Since the task is to build a tree structure from a string of words, we can use a mechanism similar to normal parsing, which builds a
