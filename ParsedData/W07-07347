modules.
    We use the freely available Perl implementation packages for Porter stemmers for the three languages (Humphrey, 2007).
    Unfortunately, we have so far been unable to obtain freely available WordNet resources for these three languages.
    METEOR versions for Spanish, French and German therefore currently include only &#8220;exact&#8221; and &#8220;stemming&#8221; matching modules.
    We are investigating the possibility of developing new synonymy modules for the various languages based on alternative methods, which could then be used in place of WordNet.
    The second main language-specific issue which required adaptation is the tuning of the three parameters within METEOR , described in section 4.
  
  
    The original version of METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) has instantiated values for three parameters in the metric: one for controlling the relative weight of precision and recall in computing the Fmean score (a); one governing the shape of the penalty as a function of fragmentation (0)
