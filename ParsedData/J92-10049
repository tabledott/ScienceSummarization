 set.
    Probabilities are determined for pairs of siblings through frequency counts on rules generated by parsing a set of training sentences.
    The parsing process achieves efficiency through structure-sharing among rules, resembling in this respect a top-down chart processor.
    The grammar nodes are contained in a static structure describing a hierarchy of permissible sibling pairs given each parent, and a node-dependent set of constraint filters.
    Each grammar node contains a name specifying its category, a two-dimensional probability array of permissible links among the next lower level in the hierarchy and a list of filter specifications to be applied either in the top-down or the bottom-up cycle.
    When a sentence is parsed, a dynamic structure is created, a set of parse nodes that are linked together in a hierarchical structure to form explicit paths through the grammar.
    During the active parse process, the parse nodes are entered into a queue prioritized by their path scores.
