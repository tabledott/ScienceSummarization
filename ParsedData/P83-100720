ining noun treatment of our theory we will consider centers that are realized by constituents in other syntactic categories.
    119831 discusses some of these issues and compares several of with Montague semantics. phrases that express functional relations (e.g., 'the door,' 'the owner') whose arguments are not exhibited explicitly (e.g., a house is the current center, but so far its door nor its owner has been it is the case that such argument can be backward-looking center of the sentence.
    We are studying such and expect to integrate that into our theory of discourse The basic rule that constrains the realization of the backward-looking center of an utterance is a constraint on the speaker, namely: the Cb the current utterance is the same as the of the previous utterance, a pronoun should be are two things to about this rule.
    First, it not preclude using for other entities as long as one is used for the center.
    Second, it is not a hard but rather principle, like a Gricean maxim, that violated.
