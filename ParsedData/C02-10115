apping (or one-to-one mapping).
			This approach, however, has a drawback of losing information in vector transformation, as will be described.
			For other methods using non-parallel corpora, see also (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Kikui, 1999, Koehn and Kevin 2000; Sumita 2000; Nakagawa 2001; Gao et al 2001).
			2.2 Translation Using Web Data.
			Web is an extremely rich source of data for natural language processing, not only in terms of data size but also in terms of data type (e.g., multilingual data, link data).
			Recently, a new trend arises in natural language processing, which tries to bring some new breakthroughs to the field by effectively using web data (e.g., Brill et al 2001).
			Nagata et al(2001), for example, proposed to collect partial parallel corpus data on the web to create a translation dictionary.
			They observed that there are many partial parallel corpora between English and Japanese on the web, and most typically English translations of Japanese terms (words or phrases) are parenthesiz
