rinciple).
    If an unlabeled vertex does not have a path to any labeled vertex, this term ensures that the converged marginal for this vertex will be uniform over all tags, allowing the middle word of such an unlabeled vertex to take on any of the possible tags.
    While it is possible to derive a closed form solution for this convex objective function, it would require the inversion of a matrix of order |Vf|.
    Instead, we resort to an iterative update based method.
    We formulate the update as follows: where &#8704;ui &#8712; Vf \ Vfl, &#947;i(y) and &#954;i are defined as: We ran this procedure for 10 iterations.
    We then extract a set of possible tags tx(y) by eliminating labels whose probability is below a threshold value &#964;: We describe how we choose &#964; in &#167;6.4.
    This vector tx is constructed for every word in the foreign vocabulary and will be used to provide features for the unsupervised foreign language POS tagger.
    We develop our POS induction model based on the feature-
