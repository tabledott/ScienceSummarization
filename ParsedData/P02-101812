 match at a higher node in t, and hence will be substituted.
    Since the substitution of one pattern typically destroys the context for a match of another pattern, the shallower patterns no longer match.
    On the other hand, since shallower patterns contain less structure they are likely to match a greater variety of trees than the deeper patterns, they still have ample opportunity to apply.
    Finally, the pattern matching process can be speeded considerably by indexing patterns appropriately, since the number of patterns involved is quite large (approximately 11,000).
    For patterns of the kind described here, patterns can be indexed on their topmost local tree (i.e., the pattern&#8217;s root node label and the sequence of node labels of its children).
    After relabelling preterminals as described above, patterns are extracted during a traversal of each of the trees in the training corpus.
    Table 2 lists the most frequent patterns extracted from the Penn Treebank training corpus.
