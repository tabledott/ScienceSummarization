8221; solution represents the first attempt to address a complex task involving content generation and labelling through the definition of a cheap and reliable pipeline of simple tasks which are easy to define, accomplish, and control. guages.
    Moreover, since the core monolingual tasks of the process are carried out by manipulating English texts, we are able to address the very large community of English speaking workers, with a considerable reduction of costs and execution time.
    Finally, as a by-product of our method, the acquired pairs are fully aligned for all language combinations, thus enabling meaningful comparisons between scenarios of different complexity (monolingual TE, and CLTE between close or distant languages).
    We believe that, in the same spirit of recent works promoting large-scale annotation efforts around entailment corpora (Sammons et al., 2010; Bentivogli et al., 2010), the proposed approach and the resulting dataset5 will contribute to meeting the strong need for resources to
