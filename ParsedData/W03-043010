 furthermore many of these features are irrelevant, and others that are relevant are excluded.
    In response, we wish to use just those time-shifted conjunctions that will significantly improve performance.
    We start with no features, and over several rounds of feature induction: (1) consider a set of proposed new features, (2) select for inclusion those candidate features that will most increase the log-likelihood of the correct state path s(j), and (3) train weights for all features.
    The proposed new features are based on the hand-crafted observational tests&#8212;consisting of singleton tests, and binary conjunctions of tests with each other and with features currently in the model.
    The later allows arbitrary-length conjunctions to be built.
    The fact that not all singleton tests are included in the model gives the designer great freedom to use a very large variety of observational tests, and a large window of time shifts.
    To consider the effect of adding a new feature, define the new s
