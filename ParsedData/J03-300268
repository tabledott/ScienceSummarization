ications, but of course this requires a &#8220;more is better&#8221; approach in order to obtain subsets that are large enough to be useful.
    The work reported in this article addresses each of these major problems.
    With respect to the number of language pairs, the Internet Archive offers us a huge sample of pages on the Web, and our techniques make it easy to explore that collection in an efficient way.
    Although it is probably impossible to crawl more than a small fraction of the Web, the Internet Archive is storing the results of commercial-scale Web crawling and has as its explicit mission the permanent storage of everything that can be found.
    The fact that we were able to find a substantial quantity of English-Arabic text (on the order of a million words per side, looking at less than a sixth of the Archive in 2002) offers the hope that it will be possible to find data for the less well-represented language pairs, if and when those data actually exist.
    Moreover, the final implementation
