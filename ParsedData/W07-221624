ined as in Section 3, but with the weight w(T) replaced by the probability distribution p(x&#945;|T, n&#945;).
    The above |L|- |E|2 relations represent a nonlinear system of equations.
    There is no closed form solution in the general case, and one adopts the expectation maximization (EM) method, which is a specialization of the standard fixed-point iteration method for the solution of non-linear systems.
    We start with some initial assignment of the parameters and at each iteration we use the induced distribution p(x&#945;|T, n&#945;) to compute a refined value for the parameters themselves.
    We are always guaranteed that the Kullback-Liebler divergence between two approximated distributions computed at successive iterations does not increase, which implies the convergence of the method to some local maxima (with the exception of saddle points).
    Observe that at each iteration we can compute quantities ((i, j)k)x&#171; and Zx&#171; in polynomial time using the algorithms from Section 3 with pkx
