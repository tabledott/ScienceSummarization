ce dependencies such as the negation of the proposition (e.g., does not look very good) or the negation of the subject (e.g., no one thinks that it&#8217;s good).
    In addition, certain phrases that contain negation words intensify rather than change polarity (e.g., not only good but amazing).
    Contextual polarity may also be influenced by modality: whether the proposition is asserted to be real (realis) or not real (irrealis) (no reason at all to believe is irrealis, for example); word sense (e.g., Environmental Trust vs.
    He has won the people&#8217;s trust); the syntactic role of a word in the sentence: whether the word is the subject or object of a copular verb (consider polluters are versus they are polluters); and diminishers such as little (e.g., little truth, little threat).
    Polanyi and Zaenen (2004) give a detailed discussion of many of these types of polarity influencers.
    Many of these contextual polarity influencers are represented as features in our experiments.
