vious application, it would map the regular language {ab} into the context-free language {atb I I &lt;n}, which we have already seen is beyond the power of regular relations.
    However, we do not forbid material produced in one application of a rule from serving as context for a subsequent application of that rule, as would routinely be the case for a vowel-harmony rule, for example.
    It is this restriction on interactions between different applications of a given rule that motivates the notation rather than A0p p The context refers to a part of the string that the current application of the rule does not change but which, since it may have been changed in a previous application, allows for an interaction between successive applications.
    The important outstanding question concerning interactions between applications of one and the same rule at different positions in a string has to do with the relative order in which they take place.
    Consider the obligatory rule a b/ab ba as applied to the string
