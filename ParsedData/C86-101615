  We consider two cases here.
  Let us assume that  the parser is in the process of t ry ing to build an instance of the rule A ~ I~ C and that  it has successfully instant ia ted B as B.
  At this point, it will enter  a part ial  instant iat ion  of the rule on the chart.
  We designate this active edge as A(B): C. Here the colon marks  the line between daughter  const i tuents  that  have been found and daughters  that  sti l l  need to be instant iated.
  When an active edge is added to the chart, the parser needs to find all the rules that  match the first un instant ia ted  const i tuent  to the r ight  of the colon.
  In the case at hand, it needs to match C aga inst  he left-hand sides of all rules to determine what  rules it should now try to instant iate.
  For example, if there is a rule C ~ D in the grammar  and C is compatible with C, a looping C: I) or C: I) edge should be added to the chart.
  In the case of an ordinary phrase-structure grammar , this match ing
