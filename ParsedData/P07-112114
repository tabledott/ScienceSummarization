 edge in F indicates a possible edge in the transformed MR parse tree.
    Intuitively, two concepts are closely related if they involve the same logical variables, and therefore, should be placed close together in the MR parse tree.
    By keeping occurrences of a logical variable in close proximity in the MR parse tree, we also avoid unnecessary variable bindings in the extracted rules.
    Step 2.
    Remove edges from F whose inclusion in the MR parse tree would prevent the NL and MR parse trees from being isomorphic.
    Step 3.
    Add edges to F to make sure that a spanning tree for F exists.
    Steps 4&#8211;6.
    Assign edge weights based on word distance, find a minimum spanning tree, T, for F, then regroup the conjuncts based on T. The choice of T reflects the intuition that words that occur close together in a sentence tend to be semantically related.
    This procedure is repeated for all conjunctions that appear in a logical form.
    Rules are then extracted from the same input alignment used
