 is that, exercising proper care, the coherence relations that hold between successive pieces of text can be formulated as the abovementioned search operators and used in a hierarchical-expansion planner to limit the search and to produce structures describing the coherent paragraphs.
    The illustrate this contention, the Penman text structurer is a simplified top-down planner (as described first by Pacerdoti 771).
    It uses a formalized version of the relations of Rhetorical Structure Theory (see immediately below) as plans.
    Its output is one (or more) tree(s) that describe the structure(s) of coherent paragraphs built from the input elements.
    Input elements are the leaves of the tree(s); they are sent to the Penman generator to be transformed into sentences.
  
  
    The heart of the problem is obviously coherence.
    Coherent text can be defined as text in which the hearer knows how each part of the text relates to the whole; i.e., (a) the hearer knows why it is said, and (b) the hearer can r
