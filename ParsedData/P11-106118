L-2007 shared tasks on dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).
    The parallel data came from the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) and the ODS United Nations dataset (UN, 2006).
    Taking the intersection of languages in these resources, and selecting languages with large amounts of parallel data, yields the following set of eight Indo-European languages: Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.
    Of course, we are primarily interested in applying our techniques to languages for which no labeled resources are available.
    However, we needed to restrict ourselves to these languages in order to be able to evaluate the performance of our approach.
    We paid particular attention to minimize the number of free parameters, and used the same hyperparameters for all language pairs, rather than attempting language-specific tuning.
    We hope that this will allow practitioners to apply our approach directly to languages for which no resources are available
