nd, of these, 13 were followed by some orthographic indicator in the transcription.
    Of 34 cue phrases that were neither preceded nor followed by orthographic markings in the transcription, the majority (21, or 61.8%) were sentential uses.
    If we predict sentential/discourse usage based simply on the presence or absence of preceding and succeeding orthographic markings, we would predict that cue phrases preceded by orthographic indicators represent discourse uses, and that phrases either followed by orthographic indicators or neither preceded nor followed would be sentential uses, for a total of 82 correct predictions for the 100 cue phrases in this study.
    Thus, 82% of nows might be orthographically distinguished.
    We will have more to say on the role of orthography in disambiguating cue phrases in connection with the study described in Section 5.
    Based on the findings of our study of now, we proposed that listeners may use prosodic information to disambiguate discourse from sentential uses o
