yntactic analyses over independent monolingual parsing.
    We presented a joint log-linear model over source trees, target trees, and node-to-node alignments between them, which is used to select an optimal tree pair from a k-best list.
    On Chinese treebank data, this procedure improves F1 by 1.8 on Chinese sentences and by 2.5 on out-of-domain English sentences.
    Furthermore, by using this joint parsing technique to preprocess the input to a syntactic MT system, we obtain a 2.4 BLEU improvement.
  
  
    We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper and Adam Pauls and Jing Zheng for help in running our MT experiments.
