e translated to spade in isolation.
    Hence, translating I have a spade with OH could yield an error.
    But enforcing competition among segmentations introduces a new problem: true translation ambiguity can also be spuriously explained by the segmentation.
    Consider the french fragment carte sur la table, which could translate to map on the table or notice on the chart.
    Using these two sentence pairs as training, one would hope to capture the ambiguity in the parameter table as: Assuming we only allow non-degenerate segmentations and disallow non-monotonic alignments, this parameter table yields a marginal likelihood P(fle) = 0.25 for both sentence pairs &#8211; the intuitive result given two independent lexical ambiguHence, a higher likelihood can be achieved by allocating some phrases to certain translations while reserving overlapping phrases for others, thereby failing to model the real ambiguity that exists across the language pair.
    Also, notice that the phrase sur la can take on an arbitr
