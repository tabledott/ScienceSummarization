estion before it, violating the independence of the P(W11U1).
    Similarly, speakers adjust their pitch or volume over time, e.g., to the conversation partner or because of the structure of the discourse (Menn and Boyce 1982), violating the independence of the P(F I U,).
    As in other areas of statistical modeling, we count on the fact that these violations are small compared to the properties actually modeled, namely, the dependence of E1 on Lli.
    Returning to the prior distribution of DA sequences P(U), it is convenient to make certain independence assumptions here, too.
    In particular, we assume that the prior distribution of L/ is Markovian, i.e., that each U, depends only on a fixed number k of preceding DA labels: (k is the order of the Markov process describing U).
    The n-gram-based discourse grammars we used have this property.
    As described later, k = 1 is a very good choice, i.e., conditioning on the DA types more than one removed from the current one does not improve the quality of t
