    One might thus feel that the approach of this paper is to walk down a slippery slope, and that we are merely arguing degrees.
    However, we believe that there is a fundamental qualitative distinction, grounded in linguistic practice, between what we see as permitted an unlexicalized against what one finds hopes to exploit in lexicalized The division rests on the traditional distinction between words closed-class words) and open class or lexical words).
    It is standard practice in linguistics, dating back decades, to annotate phrasal nodes with important functiondistinctions, for example to have a a whereas content words are not part of grammatical structure, and one would not have sperules or constraints for an for example.
    We follow this approach in our model: various closed classes are subcategorized to better represent important distinctions, and important features commonly expressed by function words are annotated phrasal nodes (such as whether a finite, or a participle,
