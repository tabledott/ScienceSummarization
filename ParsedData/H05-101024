			We have presented a novel discriminative, large margin method for learning word-alignment models on the basis of arbitrary features of wordpairs.
			We have shown that our method is suitable for the common situation where a moder ate number of good, fairly general features must be balanced on the basis of a small amount of labeled data.
			It is also likely that the method will be useful in conjunction with a large labeled alignment corpus (should such a set be created).
			We presented features capturing a few separate sources of information, producing alignments on the order of those given by unsymmetrized IBM Model 4 (using labeled training data of about the size others have used to tune generative models).
			In addition, when given bi-directional Model 4 predictions as features, our method provides a 22% AER reduction over intersected Model 4 predictions alone.
			The resulting 5.4 AER on the English-French Hansarks task is,to our knowledge, the best published AE
