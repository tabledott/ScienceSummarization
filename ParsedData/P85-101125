e where s ?ode Y has only one child X If X E A~i,j,k,ll then put Y in A[i,j,k,l[.
  Repe~t Case 4 again if Y has us siblings.
  Complex i ty  of  the  A lsor l thm It is obvious that steps I0 through 15 (cases a-e) are completed in 0(?-*), beta?an the different cases have at most two nested for loop statements, the iterating variables taking values in the range 0 thro?gh u.
  They are repeated utmost 0( ?
  4) times, because o( the four loop statements i?
  steps 6 through 9.
  The initialization phase (steps 1 through 5) has a time complexity of 0( ?
  Step 15 is completed in O(?).
  Therefore, the time complexity of the parsing algorithm is O(?S).
  Cot ,~.etnem of tha  A l lo r l thm The main issue in proving the algorithm correct, is to show that while computing the contents of an element of the array A, we must have already determined the contents of other elements of the array needed to correctly complete this entry.
  We can show this inductively by considering each cue individually.
