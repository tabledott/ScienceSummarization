 candidate input vectors X.
    Then, for each vector X, a search process exhaustively constructs and scores all possible output vectors Y according to the measure P(Y I X) (this computation is feasible because the number of TACIT fields is normally small).
    These scores are combined with the pre-discourse scores P(Ms,T) P(W IT) , already computed by the semantic interpretation process.
    This computation yields: The highest scoring theory is then selected, and a straightforward computation derives the final meaning frame MD from output vector Y.
  
  
    We have trained and evaluated the system on a common corpus of utterances collected from naive users in the ATIS domain.
    In this test, the system was trained on approximately 4000 ATIS 2 and ATIS 3 sentences, and then evaluated on the December 1994 test material (which was held aside as a blind test set).
    The combined system produced an error rate of 21.6%.
    Work on the system is ongoing, however, and interested parties are encouraged to con
