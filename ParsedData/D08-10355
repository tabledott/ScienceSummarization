    In both cases our model achieves performance surpassing multiple state-of-the-art baselines.
    Moreover, we demonstrate that the addition of cue phrases can further improve segmentation performance over cohesion-based methods.
    In addition to the practical advantages demonstrated by these experimental results, our model reveals interesting theoretical properties.
    Other researchers have observed relationships between discourse structure and entropy (e.g., Genzel and Charniak, 2002).
    We show that in a special case of our model, the segmentation objective is equal to a weighted sum of the negative entropies for each topic segment.
    This finding demonstrates that a relationship between discourse segmentation and entropy is a natural consequence of modeling topic structure in a generative Bayesian framework.
    In addition, we show that the benchmark segmentation system of Utiyama and Isahara (2001) can be viewed as another special case of our Bayesian model.
