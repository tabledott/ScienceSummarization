inite constructions.
    Examples from the three methods can be found in the Appendix.
    Our methods for identifying existential NPs are all heuristic-based and therefore can be incorrect in certain situations.
    We identified two types of common errors.
    To address these problems, we developed a vaccine.
    It was clear that we had a number of infections in our Si list, including &amp;quot;the base,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the For every definite NP in a text individuals,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the attack,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the banks.&amp;quot; We noticed, however, that many of these incorrect NPs also appeared near the bottom of our definite/indefinite list, indicating that they were often seen in indefinite constructions.
    We used the definite probability measure as a way of detecting errors in the Si and EHP lists.
    If the definite probability of an NP was above an upper threshold, the NP was allowed to be classified as existential.
    If the definite probability of an NP fell below a lower t
