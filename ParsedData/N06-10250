  Exploiting Semantic Role Labeling WordNet And Wikipedia For Coreference Resolution
  
    In this paper we present an extension of a machine learning based coreference resolution system which uses features induced from different semantic knowledge sources.
    These features represent knowledge mined from WordNet and Wikipedia, as well as information about semantic role labels.
    We show that semantic features indeed improve the performance on different referring expression types such as pronouns and common nouns.
  
  
    The last years have seen a boost of work devoted to the development of machine learning based coreference resolution systems (Soon et al., 2001; Ng &amp; Cardie, 2002; Yang et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2004, inter alia).
    While machine learning has proved to yield performance rates fully competitive with rule based systems, current coreference resolution systems are mostly relying on rather shallow features, such as the distance between the coreferent expressions, string matching, and
