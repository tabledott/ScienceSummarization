%), regardless of transitivity, in order to measure whether the data in fact reflect the alternations between syntactic and semantic roles that the verb classes predict.
  For each verb, we show counts only for occurrences tagged as belonging to the first frameset, reflecting the predominant or unmarked sense.
  6.2.2 Results of Prediction 1.
  The object-drop verbs of Merlo and Stevenson do in fact show little variability in our corpus, with the subject almost always being Arg0.
  The unergative and unaccusative verbs show much more variability in the roles that can appear in the subject position, as predicted, although some individual verbs always have Arg0 as subject, presumably as a result of the small number of occurrences.
  6.2.3 Results of Prediction 2.
  As predicted, there is in general a greater preponderance of Arg1 subjects for unaccusatives than for unergatives, with the striking exception of a few unergative verbs, such as jump and rush, whose subjects are almost always Arg1.
  Jump is being af
