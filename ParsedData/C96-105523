etween LDOCE codes and Levin classes, in mnch the same way that we associated syntactic signatures with the semantic lasses in the earlier experiments.
  These canonical codes are for syntactic filtering (checking for the closest match) in the classification algorithm.
  As an example of how the word-sense disambigua- tion process and classifcation, consider the non-Levin verb attempt.
  The LDOCE specification for this verb is: T1 T3 T4 WV5 N. Using the synonymy feature of WordNet, the algorithm automatically extracts tire candidate classes associated with the synonyms of this word: (1) Class 29.6 "Masquerade Verbs" (ace), (2) Class 29.8 "Captain Verbs" (pioneer), (3) Class 31.1 "Amuse Verbs" (try), (4) Class 35.6 "Ferret Verbs" (seek), and (5) Class 55.2 "Complete Verbs" (initiate).
  The synonyms for each of these classes have the follow- ing LDOCE encodiugs, respectively: (1) I I -FOIl I-ON I-UPON LI L9 T1 N; (2) L9 T1 N; (3) I T1 T3 T4 WV4 N; (4) ~ bAF[EI~ I-FOR T1 T3; and (5) T1 T I - INTO N. The larges
