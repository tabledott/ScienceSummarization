re packed into an equivalence class.
    However, Figure 14 shows that the values of CONT, that is, predicate&#8211;argument structures, have different values, and the signs as they are cannot be equivalent.
    As seen in this example, predicate&#8211;argument structures prevent us from packing signs into equivalence classes.
    In this section, we apply the feature forest model to predicate&#8211;argument structures, which may include reentrant structures and non-local dependencies.
    It is theoretically difficult to apply the feature forest model to predicate&#8211;argument structures; a feature forest cannot represent graph structures that include reentrant structures in a straightforward manner.
    However, if predicate&#8211;argument structures are constructed as in the manner described subsequently, they can be represented by feature forests of a tractable size.
    Feature forests can represent predicate&#8211;argument structures if we assume some locality and monotonicity in the composition of pr
