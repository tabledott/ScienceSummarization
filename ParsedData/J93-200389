    In order to apply these algorithms, we need to solve the maximization problems of Steps 2 and 4.
    For the models that we consider, we can do this explicitly.
    To exhibit the basic form of the solution, we suppose Po is a model given by where the OM, w E Q, are real-valued parameters satisfying the constraints and for each w and (a, f, e), c(w ; a, f, e) is a non-negative integer.'
    We interpret 0(w) as the probability of the event w and c(w; a, f, e) as the number of times that this event occurs in (a, f, e).
    Note that The values for 0 that maximize the relative objective function R(I50, Po) subject to the contraints (59) are determined by the Kuhn-Tucker conditions where A is a Lagrange multiplier, the value of which is determined by the equality constraint in Equation (59).
    These conditions are both necessary and sufficient for a maximum since R(P6, Po) is a concave function of the 0(w).
