e procedure elects this option, then a constant, log prob(NULL), is added to the score.
  This value is set so that the matching procedure will avoid making hard decisions when it isnt sure.
  For example, the 5 ~h English word (in) could have been matched with 16 ~h French word (en), but it didnt do so because log prob(NULL) was more than the score of such a radical reordering.
  We have found that -5 is a good 156 setting for log prob(match).
  If we set the value much higher, then the matching procedure attempts to reorder the text too much.
  If we set the value much lower, then the matching procedure does not attempt to reorder the text enough.
  This matching procedure works remarkably well.
  As mentioned above, based on a sample of 800 sentences, we estimate that the procedure matches 61% of the English words with some French word, and about 95% of these pairs match the English word with the appropriate French word.
  All but one of these rrors of commission involved a function word, usually one surro
