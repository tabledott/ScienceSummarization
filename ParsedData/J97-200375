omata.
    Brzozowski (1962) showed that determinization can be used to minimize automata.
    This nice result has also been proved more recently in elegant papers by Bauer (1988) and Urbanek (1989).
    These authors refine the method to obtain better complexities.19 Theorem 16 (Brzozowski 1962) Let A be a nondeterministic automaton.
    Then the automaton A' = (Q', i',F',E,6') obtained by reversing A, applying determinization, rereversing the obtained automaton and determiruizing it is the minimal deterministic automaton equivalent to A.
    We generalize this theorem to the case of string-to-weight transducers.
    We say that a rational power series S is bisubsequential when S is subsequential and the power series SR = EwEE.
    (5, wR)w is also subsequential.'
    Not all subsequential transducers are bisubsequential.
    Figure 22 shows a transducer representing a power series S that is not bisubsequential.
    S is such that: The transducer of Figure 22 is subsequential so S is subsequential.
    But
