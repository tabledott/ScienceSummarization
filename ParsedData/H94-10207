 a prerequisite for high levels of inter-annotator agreement.
  It is our hope that such a stylebook will also alleviate much of the need for ex- tensive cross-talk between annotators during the annotation task, thereby increasing throughput as well.
  To ensure that the rules of this new stylebook remain in force, we intend to give annotators about 10% overlapped material to evaluate inter-annotator consistency throughout this new project.
  The remainder of this paper discusses the implementation of each of the four points above, as well as notational de- vices to allow predicate-argument structure to be recovered in the face of conjoined structure involving gapping, where redundant syntactic structure within a conjoined structure is deleted.
  CONSISTENT GRAMMATICAL ANALYSES The current reebank materials uffer from the fact that dif- fering annotation regimes are used across differing syntactic categories.
  To allow easy automatic extraction of predicate- argument structure in particular, these differing
