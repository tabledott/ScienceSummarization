			A statisti cal model can be used to determine the most likelycategories given the word?s context.
			The advantage of this supertagging approach is that the number of categories assigned to each word can be re duced, with a correspondingly massive reduction in the number of derivations.
			Bangalore and Joshi (1999) use a standard Markov model tagger to assign LTAG elementarytrees to words.
			Here we use the Maximum En tropy models described in Curran and Clark (2003).
