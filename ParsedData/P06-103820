e with those obtained by a baseline clustering algorithm.
    For the baseline, we implemented k-means as follows.
    We have removed stopwords from the corpus, and then used as features the words which appear before or after the target word.
    In the calculation of feature values and inter-vector distances, and in the removal of less informative features, we have strictly followed (Pantel and Lin, 2002).
    We ran the algorithm 10 times using k = 500 with randomly selected centroids, producing 5000 clusters.
    We then merged the resulting clusters using the same 50% overlap criterion as in our algorithm.
    The result included 3090, 2116, and 3206 clusters for Dmoz, BNC and Russian respectively.
    We used 8 subjects for evaluation of the English categories and 15 subjects for evaluation of the Russian ones.
    In order to assess the subjects&#8217; reliability, we also included random categories (see below.)
    The experiment contained two parts.
    In Part I, subjects were given 40 triplets of w
