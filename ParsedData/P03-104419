narios are very close&#8212;i.e., share many semantic features&#8212;they will inhibit each other, and result in lower recall.
    This closeness will need to be qualified at a future time.
    There is &#8220;ambiguity&#8221; both at the level of documents as well as at the level of patterns.
    Document ambiguity means that some documents cover more than one topic, which will lead to high relevance scores in multiple scenarios.
    This is more common for longer documents, and may therefore disfavor patterns contained in such documents.
    An important issue is the extent of overlap among scenarios: Management Succession and Mergers and Acquisitions are likely to have more documents in common than either has with Natural Disasters.
    Patterns may be pragmatically or semantically ambiguous; &#8220;Person died&#8221; is an indicator for Management Succession, as well as for Natural Disasters.
    The pattern &#8220;win race&#8221; caused the sports scenario to learn patterns for political elections.
