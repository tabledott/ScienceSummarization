 the extension of both of them.
    This possibility would be excluded if there were a path in one of the two descriptions that lead to an atomic value while the same path in the other one lead to some other value.
    This would occur if, for example, one described a sentence with a singular subject and the other a sentence with a plural subject, or if one described a sentence and the other a noun phrase.
    There can also be incompatibilities in respect of other kinds of value.
    Thus, if one has a pattern requiring the subject to precede the main verb whereas the other specifies the other order, the two descriptions will be incompatible.
    Constituent sets are incompatible if they are not the same.
    We have briefly considered how three different types of description behave under unification.
    Implicit in what we have said is that descriptions of different types do not unify with one another.
    Grammars, which are the descriptions of the infinite sets of sentences that make up a language consti
