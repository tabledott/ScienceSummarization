nservative in that it does not reject a sense unless it is impossible for it to fit into the preference pattern of the sentence.
    In order to explain this process more fully we provide a walk-through explanation of the procedure applied to a toy example shown in Table 5.
    It is assumed that the named-entity identifier has correctly identified John as a person and that the shallow parser has found the correct syntactic relations.
    In order to make this example as straightforward as possible, we consider only the case in which the ambiguous words have few senses.
    The disambiguation process operates by considering the relations between the words in known grammatical relations, and before it begins we have essentially a set of possible senses for each word related via their syntax.
    This situation is represented by the topmost tree in Figure 4.
    Disambiguation is carried out by considering each verb sense in turn, beginning with run(1).
    As run is being used transitively, it places two restr
