r this grammar, a series of nested constituents with the same orientation will always have a left-heavy derivation.
    The guarantee that parsing will produce a tail-recursive tree facilitates easily identification of those nesting levels that are associative (and therefore arbitrary), so that those levels can be &amp;quot;flattened&amp;quot; by a postprocessing stage after parsing into non-normal form trees like the one in Figure 9(c).
    The algorithm proceeds bottom-up, eliminating as many brackets as possible, by making use of the associativity equivalences [[AB]C] ,=s [ABC] and ((AB)C) (ABC).
    The singleton bidirectionality and flipping commutativity equivalences (see Lemma 4) can also be applied whenever they render the associativity equivalences applicable.
    Experiment.
    Approximately 2,000 sentence-pairs with both English and Chinese lengths of 30 words or less were extracted from our corpus and bracketed using the algorithm described.
    Several additional criteria were used to filter out
