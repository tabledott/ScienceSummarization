nce.
    This is largely because SCFG only allows sibling nodes reordering and fails to utilize both non-syntactic phrases and those syntactic phrases that cannot be covered by a single CFG rule.
    It thereby suggests that SCFG is less effective in modelling parse tree structure transfer between Chinese and English when using Penn Treebank style linguistic grammar and under wordalignment constraints.
    However, formal SCFG show much better performance in the formally syntax-based translation framework (Chiang, 2005).
    This is because the formal syntax is learned from phrases directly without relying on any linguistic theory (Chiang, 2005).
    As a result, it is more robust to the issue of non-syntactic phrase usage and non-isomorphic structure alignment.
    26.07 further improves the performance.
    It suggests that they are complementary to each other since the lexicalized TSRs are used to model non-syntactic phrases while the other two kinds of TSRs can generalize the lexicalized rules to unseen p
