ailable to the research community are for the moment limited to texts produced by international organizations (European Parliament, United Nations, Canadian Hansard), press agencies, and technical manuals.
    The limited availability of parallel data poses challenging questions regarding the portability of SMT across different application domains and language pairs, and its adaptability with respect to language variability within the same application domain.
    This work focused on the second issue, namely the adaptation of a Spanish-to-English phrasebased SMT system across two apparently close domains: the United Nation corpus and the European Parliament corpus.
    Cross-domain adaptation is faced under the assumption that only monolingual texts are available, either in the source language or in the target language.
    The paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 presents previous work on the problem of adaptation in SMT; Section 3 introduces the exemplar task and research questions we addressed; Sec
