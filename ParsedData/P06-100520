ll as the MI between the pronoun and the noun&#8217;s parent as features in our pronoun resolution classifier.
    Kehler et al. (2004) saw no apparent gain from using semantic compatibility information, while Yang et al.
    (2005) saw about a 3% improvement with compatibility data acquired by searching on the world wide web.
    Section 6 analyzes the contribution of MI to our system.
    Bean and Riloff (2004) used bootstrapping to extend their semantic compatibility model, which they called contextual-role knowledge, by identifying certain cases of easily-resolved anaphors and antecedents.
    They give the example &#8220;Mr.
    Bush disclosed the policy by reading it.&#8221; Once we identify that it and policy are coreferent, we include read:obj:policy as part of the compatibility model.
    Rather than using manually-defined heuristics to bootstrap additional semantic compatibility information, we wanted to enhance our MI statistics automatically with coreferent paths.
    Consider the phrase, &#8220;S
