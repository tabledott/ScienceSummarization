    Our work began with the simple idea of using an extremely specific pattern to extract semantic class members with high accuracy.
    Our expectation was that a very specific pattern would virtually eliminate the most common types of false hits that are caused by phenomena such as polysemy and idiomatic expressions.
    A concern, however, was that an extremely specific pattern would suffer from sparse data and not extract many new instances.
    By using the web as a corpus, we hoped that the pattern could extract at least a few instances for virtually any class, and then we could gain additional traction by bootstrapping these instances.
    All of the work presented in this paper uses just one doubly-anchored pattern to identify candidate instances for a semantic class: &lt;class name&gt; such as &lt;class member&gt; and * This pattern has two variables: the name of the semantic class to be learned (class name) and a member of the semantic class (class member).
