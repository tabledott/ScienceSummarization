lization (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Zhou et al., 2006; Owczarzak et al., 2006), and machine translation both by dealing with out of vocabulary words and phrases (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) and by expanding the set of reference translations for minimum error rate training (Madnani et al., 2007).
    While all applications require the preservation of meaning when a phrase is replaced by its paraphrase, some additionally require the resulting sentence to be grammatical.
    In this paper we examine the effectiveness of placing syntactic constraints on a commonly used paraphrasing technique that extracts paraphrases from parallel corpora (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).
    The paraphrasing technique employs various aspects of phrase-based statistical machine translation including phrase extraction heuristics to obtain bilingual phrase pairs from word alignments.
    English phrases are considered to be potential paraphrases of each other if they share a common foreign language phrase among their translati
