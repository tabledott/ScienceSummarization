per has been to highlight the difficulties associated with cross-formalism parser comparison.
    Note that the difficulties are not unique to CCG, and many would apply to any crossformalism comparison, especially with parsers using automatically extracted grammars.
    Parser evaluation has improved on the original Parseval measures (Carroll et al., 1998), but the challenge remains to develop a representation and evaluation suite which can be easily applied to a wide variety of parsers and formalisms.
    Despite the difficulties, we have given the first evaluation of a CCG parser outside of CCGbank, outperforming the RASP parser by over 5% overall and on the majority of dependency types.
    Can the CCG parser be compared with parsers other than RASP?
    Briscoe and Carroll (2006) give a rough comparison of RASP with the Parc LFG parser on the different versions of DepBank, obtaining similar results overall, but they acknowledge that the results are not strictly comparable because of the different annotati
