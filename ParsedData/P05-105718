ed is supervised, relying on a hand-aligned bilingual corpus, while the baseline approach of IBM alignments is unsupervised.
    Currently, we only employ three types of knowledge sources as feature functions.
    Syntax-based translation models, such as tree-to-string model (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and tree-to-tree model (Gildea, 2003), may be very suitable to be added into log-linear models.
    It is promising to optimize the model parameters directly with respect to AER as suggested in statistical machine translation (Och, 2003).
