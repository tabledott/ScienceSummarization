 the basis of simple prosodic features.
  
  
    A third way in which acoustic knowledge can assist in detecting and correcting repairs is in the recognition of word fragments.
    As shown earlier, fragments are exceedingly common; they occurred in 366 of our 607 repairs.
    Fragments pose difficulty for state-of-the-art recognition systems because most recognizers are constrained to produce strings of actual words, rather than allowing partial words as output.
    Because so many repairs involve fragments, if fragments are not represented in the recognizer output, then information relevant to the processing of repairs is lost.
    We found that often when a fragment had sufficient acoustic energy, one of two recognition errors occurred.
    Either the fragment was misrecognized as a complete word, or it caused a recognition error on a neighboring word.
    Therefore if recognizers were able to flag potential word fragments, this information could aid subsequent processing by indicating the higher likeliho
