    For example, since x1 is an argument of the state predicate as well as answer and area, x1 must be bound (cf. the corresponding tree node in Figure 2(b)).
    The rule extracted for the state predicate is shown in Figure 3.
    The case for the internal nodes of the MR parse tree is similar.
    Given an MRL production, A &#8212;* Q, where Q contains non-terminals A1, ... , An, a rule A &#8212;* (&#945;, Axi1 ... Axik.Q&#8242;) is extracted such that: (1) &#945; is the NL phrase linked to the MRL production, with non-terminals A1, ... , An showing the positions of the argument strings; (2) Q&#8242; is Q with each non-terminal Aj replaced with Aj(xj1, ... , xjkj ), where xj1, ... , xjkj are the bound variables in the A-function used to rewrite Aj; (3) xi1, ... , xik are the logical variables that appear in Q&#8242; and outside the current MR sub-parse.
    For example, see the rule extracted for the smallest predicate in Figure 3, where x2 is an argument of smallest, but it does not appear outside the form
