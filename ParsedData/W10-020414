    This was a welcome result showing that, largely, the annotations were done in a responsible manner.
    We discarded all assignments that had the wrong answer for the word choice question.
    If an annotator obtained an overall score that is less than 66.67% on the word choice questions (that is, got more than one out of three wrong), then we assumed that, contrary to instructions, HITs for words not familiar to the annotator were attempted.
    We discarded and rejected all assignments by such annotators (not just the assignments for which they got the word choice question wrong).
    HITs pertaining to all the discarded assignments were uploaded for a second time on Mechanical Turk and the validation process was repeated.
    After the second round, we had three or more valid assignments for 2081 of the 2176 target terms.
    We will refer to this set of assignments as the master set.
