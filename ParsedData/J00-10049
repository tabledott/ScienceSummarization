 starting at the leftmost input symbol and setting the positions of the first transition taken to a = 0 and /3 = 0, and the positions for subsequent transitions to a = 1 and )3 = 1.
    However, we can illustrate the fact that head transducers are more Head transducer to reverse an input string of arbitrary length in the alphabet {a, b}. expressive than left-to-right transducers by the case of a finite-state head transducer that reverses a string of arbitrary length.
    (This cannot be performed by a traditional transducer with a finite number of states.)
    For example, the head transducer described below (and shown in Figure 2) with input alphabet {a, b} will reverse an input string of arbitrary length in that alphabet.
    The states of the example transducer are Q = {qi, q2} and F .--- {q2}, and it has the following transitions (costs are ignored here): The only possible complete derivations of the transducer read the input string right to left, but write it left to right, thus reversing the string.
