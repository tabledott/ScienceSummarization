			combination of the two align ments.
			We evaluated the resulting alignments of the final test set, with the results shown in Table 2.
			As these tables show, our discriminatively trained CLP-based models compare favorably to IBMModel 4 on this data set.
			The one with condi tional link probabilities from the heuristic alignment model, CLP 2 , performs slightly better than the best of the Model 4 combinations, and the one with conditional link probabilities from the LLR-based model, CLP 1 , performs only slightly worse.
			An interesting question is why CLP 2outper formed CLP 1 . CLP.
			1 is the more ?principled?

			We believe the most likely explanation is the fact that 4Thanks to Chris Quirk for carrying out this alignment.
			CLP 2 received 403,195 link probabilities from the heuristic model, while CLP 1 received only 144,051 link probabilities from the LLR-based model.
			Hence CLP 2 was able to consider more possib
