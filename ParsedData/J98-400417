99 times in section 22.
    Thus f 0.48 in both the F2-21 subcorpora and the F22 corpus.
    Returning to the theoretical analysis, the relative frequency counts C1 and the nonunit production probability estimates Pi for the PCFG induced from this two-tree corpus are as follows: Of course, in a real treebank the counts of all these productions would also include their occurrences in other constructions, so the theoretical analysis presented here is but a crude idealization.
    Empirical studies using actual corpus data are presented in Section 5.
    Thus the estimated likelihoods using Pi of the tree structures (Ai) and (Bi) are: Clearly Pi (Ai) &lt;f and Pi (B1) &lt; (1 &#8212; f) except at f =- 0 and f = 1, so in general the estimated frequencies using P1 differ from the frequencies of (A1) and (B1) in the training corpus.
    This is not too surprising, as the PCFG ii assigns nonzero probability to trees not in the training corpus (e.g., to trees with more than one PP).
    In any case, in the parsing ap
