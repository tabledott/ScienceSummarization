f values of the third index.
    Thus, the natural choice for labeling a mode-n fiber is to use the pair formed by the labels of the two index elements that are fixed.
    Specifically, each mode-n fiber of a tensor X&#955; is labeled with the binary tuple whose elements are the labels of the corresponding fixed index elements.
    For instance, given the labeled tensor in Table 2, the mode-1 fiber x&#8222;11 = (40,16.7, 5.2) is labeled with the pair (own, bomb), the mode-2 fiber x2&#8222;1 = (16.7, 69.5) is labeled with the pair (sergeant, bomb), and the mode-3 fiber x32&#8222; = (7.0, 4.7, 53.6) is labeled with the pair (teacher, use).
    Because mode-n fibers are the columns of the matrices obtained through mode-n matricization, we define the operation of labeled mode-n matricization that, given a labeled third-order tensor X&#955;, maps each entry (i1 : &#955;1, i2 : &#955;2, i3 : &#955;3) to the labeled entry (in : &#955;n, j : &#955;j) such that j is obtained according to Equation (1), and &#955;j is t
