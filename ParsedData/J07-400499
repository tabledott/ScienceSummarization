ch as the subject of to in a to-infinitival construction, which are not in CCGbank either.
    In order to provide a fair evaluation, we ignore those dependency relations.
    This still leaves some minor differences.
    We can measure the remaining differences as follows: Comparing the CCGbank dependencies in Section 00 against those generated by running our parser over the derivations in 00 gives labeled precision and recall values of 99.80% and 99.18%, respectively.
    Thus there are a small number of dependencies in CCGbank which the current version of the parser can never get right.
    10.2.1 Dependency Model vs. Normal-Form Model.
    Table 6 shows the results for the normalform and dependency models evaluated against the predicate&#8211;argument dependencies in CCGbank.
    Gold standard POS tags were used; the LF(POS) column gives the labeled F-score with automatically assigned POS tags for comparison.
    Decoding with the dependency model involves finding the maximum-recall dependency structure,
