d, if applicable, the person to whom the death is attributed (AGENT OF DEATH).
    To produce the mappings we used training data that consists of: (1) texts, and (2) their corresponding filled templettes.
    Each templette has pointers back to the source text similarly to the example presented in Figure 1.
    When the predicate argument structures were identified, the mappings were collected as illustrated in Figure 9.
    Figure 9(a) shows an interesting aspect of the mappings.
    Although the role classification of the last argument is incorrect (it should have been identified as ARG4), it is mapped into the CURRENT-VALUE slot.
    This shows how the mappings resolve incorrect but consistent classifications.
    Figure 9(b) shows the flexibility of the system to identify and classify constituents that are not close to the predicate phrase (ARG0).
    This is a clear advantage over the FSA-based system, which in fact missed the AGENT-OF-DEATH in this sentence.
    Because several templettes might describe
