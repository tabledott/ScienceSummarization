 be also ambiguous.
    Which sense do we therefore choose?
    The second problem is that there may, in fact, be no exact match in the training corpus for the context surrounding words and their relations.
    To overcome both of these problems we have applied the concept of semantic distance discussed above.
    Every possible sense of all the related context words is evaluated and the best match.Chosen5.
    The proposed unsupervised similarity-based iterative algorithm for the word sense disambiguation of the training corpus looks as follows: &amp;quot;-for each quadruple Q in the training set: for each ambiguous word in the quadruple: * among the remaining quadruples find a set S of similar quadruples (those with quadruple distance &lt; SDT) for each non-empty set S: * choose the nearest similar quadruple from the set S * disambiguate the ambiguous word to the nearest sense of the corresponding word of the chosen nearest quadruple * increase the Similarity Distance Threshold SDT = SDT + 0.1 Until all the
