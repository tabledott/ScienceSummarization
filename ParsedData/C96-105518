  By h)cnsing on the classes, the verbs are implicitly disambiguated: the word sense is by def- inition the sense of the verb as a member of a given class.
  To compare these signatures with the previous verb-based signatures, it may be helpfnl to note that a verb-based signature is the union of all of the class~ based signatures of the semantic lasses that the verb appears m. Fhe outline for this class-based exl)eriment is as fol- lows: 1.
  Automatically extract syntactic information from tile example sentences to yMd the syntactic signatnre for the class.
  Determine which semantic classes have uniquely- identifying syntactic signatures.
  If we use the class-based syntactic signatures contain- ing t)rcposition-marked pps and both positive and neg- ative evidence, the 1668 example sentences reduce to 282 syntactic patterns, just as be
