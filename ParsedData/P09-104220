r noun, preposition, particle and adverb children.
    The second rule is that auxiliary verbs should dominate main verbs and adopt their children.
    We have a list of 12 Bulgarian auxiliary verbs.
    The &#8220;seven rules&#8221; experiments add rules for 5 more words similar to the rule for &#8220;,qa&#8221;, specifically &#8220;zIe&#8221;, &#8220;JIH&#8221;, &#8220;KaKB&#9830;&#8221;, &#8220;He&#8221;, &#8220;3a&#8221;.
    Table 3 compares the errors for different linguistic rules.
    When we train using the &#8220;,qa&#8221; rule and the rules for auxiliary verbs, the model learns that main verbs attach to auxiliary verbs and that &#8220;,qa&#8221; dominates its nonfinite clause.
    This causes an improvement in the attachment of verbs, and also drastically reduces words being attached to verbs instead of particles.
    The latter is expected because &#8220;,qa&#8221; is analyzed as a particle in the Bulgarian POS tagset.
    We see an improvement in root/verb confusions since &#8220;,qa&#8221; is s
