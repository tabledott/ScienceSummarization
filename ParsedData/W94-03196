lar set of modules, and they all use a pipeline architecture to connect the modules; i.e., the modules are linearly ordered, and information flows from each module to its successor in the pipeline, with no feedback from later modules to earlier modules.
    The actual modules possessed by the systems (discussed in more detail in Section 4, as is the pipeline architecture) are: Content Determination: This maps the initial input of the generation system (e.g., a query to be answered, or an intention to be satisfied) onto a semantic form, possibly annotated with rhetorical (e.g., RST) relations.
    Sentence Planning.
    Many names have been used for this process; here I use one suggested by Rambow and Korelsky [1992].
