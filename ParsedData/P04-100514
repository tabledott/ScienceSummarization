aining corpora; this turns out to be important as the size of the training data for the different distributions varies greatly.
    The first distribution is defined over the words in source sentences (i.e., that do not contain reparandums or interregnums).
    Pn(repair|W) is the probability of a repair beginning after a word W in the source sentence X; it is estimated from the training sentences with reparandums and interregnums removed.
    Here and in what follows, W ranges over E &#57740; {$}, where &#8216;$&#8217; is a distinguished beginning-ofsentence marker.
    For example, Pn(repair|flight) is the probability of a repair beginning after the word flight.
    Note that repairs are relatively rare; in our training data Pn(repair) &#57739; 0.02, which is a fairly strong bias against repairs.
    The other distributions are defined over aligned reparandum/repair strings, and are estimated from the aligned repairs extracted from the training data.
    In training we ignored all overlapping repairs (i.e.,
