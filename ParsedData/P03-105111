 to (8), if a stem is followed by a potential suffix +m, not present in the training corpus, then it is filtered out as an illegitimate stem.
    In addition, if a stem is preceded by a prefix and/or followed by a suffix with a significantly higher proportion than that observed in the training corpus, it is filtered out.
    For instance, the probability for the suffix +A to follow a stem is less than 50% in the training corpus regardless of the stem properties, and therefore, if a candidate stem is followed by +A with the probability of over 70%, e.g. mAnyl +A, then it is filtered out as an illegitimate stem.
  
  
    We present experimental results illustrating the impact of three factors on segmentation error rate: (i) the base algorithm, i.e. language model training and decoding, (ii) language model vocabulary and training corpus size, and (iii) manually segmented training corpus size.
    Segmentation error rate is defined in (9).
    Evaluations have been performed on a development test corpus containi
