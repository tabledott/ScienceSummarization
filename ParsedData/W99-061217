gned).
    Other language-specific orthographic clues could potentially affect this initial probability mass assignment.
    When no tokenization is applied, we have to consider possible starting and ending points.
    Therefore, the strings (which, for simplicity, we will refer as well as tokens) introduced in the prefix morphological trie and the ones introduced in the suffix trie may differ.
    The left context of each token is introduced, letters in reverse order, in the left context trie, with pointers to the token in the morphlogical prefix trie; the right context of each token is introduced, in normal order, in the right context trie, keeping pointers to the token in the suffix trie.
    The distributions along the paths are modified according to the a priori distribution of the targeted token.
    This stage is the core bootstrapping phase of the algorithm.
    In essence, as contextual models become better estimated, they identify additional named entities with increasing confidence, allowing reesti
