  Watson  Research  Center ABSTRACT We describe a generative probabilistic model of natural an- guage, which we call HBG, that takes advantage of detailed linguistic information to resolve ambiguity.
  HBG incorpo- rates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way.
  We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Tree- bank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence.
  This stands in contrast o the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection i the hope of generating the correct parse.
  In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabflistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model si
