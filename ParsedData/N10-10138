    Our approach is similar to standard vector-space models of word meaning, with the addition of a perword-type clustering step: Occurrences for a specific word type are collected from the corpus and clustered using any appropriate method (&#167;3.1).
    Similarity between two word types is then computed as a function of their cluster centroids (&#167;3.2), instead of the centroid of all the word&#8217;s occurrences.
    Figure 1 gives an overview of this process.
    Multiple prototypes for each word w are generated by clustering feature vectors v(c) derived from each occurrence c E C(w) in a large textual corpus and collecting the resulting cluster centroids 7rk(w), k E [1, K].
    This approach is commonly employed in unsupervised word sense discovery; however, we do not assume that clusters correspond to traditional word senses.
    Rather, we only rely on clusters to capture meaningful variation in word usage.
    Our experiments employ
