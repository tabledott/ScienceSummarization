edicted from the quality of the initial model and the similarity between the tagged training corpus (if any) and the corpus to be tagged.
    Heuristics for deciding how to use re-estimation in an effective manner are given.
    The conclusions are broadly in agreement with those of Merialdo (1994), but give greater detail about the contributions of different parts of the model.
    1 Background Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning grammatical categories to individual words in a corpus.
    One widely used approach makes use of a statistical technique called a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
    The model is defined by two collections of the probabilities, express the probability that a tag follows the preceding (or two for a second order model); and the the probability that a word has a given tag without regard to words on either side of it.
    To tag a text, the tags with non-zero probability are hypothesised for each word, and the most probable sequence of tags given the sequence of words is dete
