n it, but the emotion lexicon will be a useful component for any sophisticated emotion detecting algorithm.
    The lexicon will also be useful for evaluating automatic methods that identify the emotions evoked by a word.
    Such algorithms may then be used to automatically generate emotion lexicons in languages where no such lexicons exist.
    As of now, high-quality high-coverage emotion lexicons do not exist for any language, although there are a few limited-coverage lexicons for a handful of languages, for example, the WordNet Affect Lexicon (WAL) (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) for six basic emotions and the General Inquirer (GI) (Stone et al., 1966), which categorizes words into a number of categories, including positive and negative semantic orientation.
