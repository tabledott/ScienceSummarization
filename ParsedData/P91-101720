on benchmark (e.g.
    Sadler (1989)) since it can be easily implemented.
    The success rate of the &amp;quot;word frequencies&amp;quot; procedure can serve as a measure for the degree of lexical ambiguity in a given set of examples, and thus different methods can be partly compared by their degree of success relative to this procedure.
    Out of the 105 ambiguous Hebrew words, for 32 the bound Ba did not pass the threshold (applicability of 70%).
    The remaining 73 examples were distributed according to the following table: Thus the precision of the statistical model was 92% (67/73)5 while relying just on word frequencies yields 64% (47/73).
    Out of the 54 ambiguous German words, for 22 the bound Ba did not pass the threshold (applicability of 59%).
    The remaining 32 examples were distributed according to the following table: Thus the precision of the statistical model was 75% (24/32), while relying just on word frequencies yields 53% (18/32).
    We attribute the lower success rate for the German
