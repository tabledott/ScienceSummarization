    Semantic Head-Driven Grammar However, in the lexical-delayed scheme the inflectional and orthographical rules are delayed.
    During the generation process the results of the morphological grammar are used directly.
    We emphasize that this is possible only because the inflectional and orthographical rules are monotonic, in the sense that they only further instantiate the feature structure of a lexical item but do not change it.
    This implies, for example, that a rule that relates an active and a passive variant of a verb will not be an inflectional rule but rather a rule in the morphological grammar, although the rule that builds a participle from a stem may in fact be an inflectional rule if it only instantiates the feature vform.
