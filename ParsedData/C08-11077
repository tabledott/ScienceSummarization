2004; Sekine, 2005).Directional Measures Most rule learning meth ods apply a symmetric similarity measure between two templates, viewing them as paraphrasing eachother.
			However, entailment is in general a direc tional relation.
			For example, ?X acquire Y ? X own Y ? and ?countersuit against X ? lawsuit against X?.
			(Weeds and Weir, 2003) propose a directional measure for learning hyponymy between twowords, ?l? r?, by giving more weight to the cov erage of the features of l by r (with ? &gt; 1 2 ): WeedsD(l, r)=?Cover(l, r)+(1??)Cover(r, l) When ?=1, this measure degenerates into Cover(l, r), termed Precision(l, r).
			With 850 Precision(l, r) we obtain a ?soft?
			version of the inclusion hypothesis presented in (Geffet and Dagan, 2005), which expects l to entail r if the ?important?
			features of l appear also in r. Similarly, the LEDIR algorithm (Bhagat et al, 2007) identifies the entailment direction between two binary templates, l and r, which participate in a relation learned by (the symmetric) D
