ch tag (for example, S(bought,VBD) or NP(IBM,NNP)).
    Thus we write a nonterminal as X(x), where x = (w, t) and X is a constituent label.
    Formally, nothing has changed, we have just vastly increased the number of nonterminals in the grammar (by up to a factor of |V |x |T |, 2 This point is actually more subtle than it first appears (we thank one of the anonymous reviewers for pointing this out), and we were unable to find proofs of this property in the literature for PCFGs.
    The rule probabilities for any nonterminal that appears with probability greater than zero in parse derivations will converge to their underlying values, by the usual properties of maximum-likelihood estimation for multinomial distributions.
    Assuming that the underlying PCFG generating training examples meet both criteria in Booth and Thompson (1973), it can be shown that convergence of rule probabilities implies that the distribution over trees will converge to that of the underlying PCFG, at least when Kullback-Liebler dive
