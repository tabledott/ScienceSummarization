s among system&#8217;s labeling results), recall (the percentage of correct holders/topics that system retrieved), and F-score.
    Baseline: For the baseline system, we applied two different algorithms for sentences which have opinion-bearing verbs as target words and for those that have opinion-bearing adjectives as target words.
    For verbs, baseline system labeled a subject of a verb as a holder and an object as a topic.
    (e.g.
    &#8220;[holder He] condemned [topic the lawyer].&#8221;) For adjectives, the baseline marked the subject of a predicate adjective as a holder (e.g.
    &#8220;[holder I] was happy&#8221;).
    For the topics of adjectives, the baseline picks a modified word if the target adjective is a modifier (e.g.
    &#8220;That was a stupid [topic mistake]&#8221;.) and a subject word if the adjective is a predicate.
    ([topic The view] is breathtaking in January.)
    Result: Table 3 and 4 show evaluation results of our system and the baseline system respectively.
