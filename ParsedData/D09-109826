al claims in (Pa&#351;ca and Durme 2008) that few seeds are necessary.
    We found that a) very small seed sets of size 1 or 2 are not sufficient for representing the intended entity set; b) 520 seeds yield on average best performance; and c) surprisingly, increasing the seed set size beyond 20 or 30 on average does not find any new correct instances.
    We inspected the effect of seed size on Rprecision over the four corpora.
    Each seed size curve is computed by averaging the system performance over the 30 random trials of all 50 sets.
    For each corpus, R-precision increased sharply from seed size 1 to 10 and the curve flattened out for seed sizes larger than 20 (figure omitted for lack of space).
    Error analysis on the Web100 corpus shows that once our model has seen 10-20 seeds, the distributional similarity model seems to have enough statistics to discover as many new correct instances as it could ever find.
    Some entities could never be found by the distributional similarity model since the
