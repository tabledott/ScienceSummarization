f 5000 raw (un-normalized) SMS messages and their manually normalized references, is constructed for training and testing.
    Evaluation by 5fold cross validation on this corpus shows that our method can achieve accuracy of 0.80702 in BLEU score compared to the baseline system of 0.6985.
    We also study the impact of our SMS text normalization on the task of SMS translation.
    The experiment of translating SMS texts from English to Chinese on a corpus comprising 402 SMS texts shows that, SMS normalization as a preprocessing step of MT can boost the translation performance from 0.1926 to 0.3770 in BLEU score.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 reviews the related work.
    Section 3 summarizes the characteristics of English SMS texts.
    Section 4 discusses our method and Section 5 reports our experiments.
    Section 6 concludes the paper.
  
  
    There is little work reported on SMS normalization and translation.
