rongly for their objects were identified, excluding verbs appearing only once in the training corpus; test instances of the form (verb, object, correct sense) were then extracted from the merged test corpus, including all triples where verb was one of the 100 test verbs.4 Evaluation materials were obtained in the same manner for several other surface syntactic relationships, including verb-subject (John admires), adjective-noun (tall building), modifier-head (river bank), and head-modifier (river z bank).
    Baseline.
    Following Miller et al. (1994), disambiguation by random choice was used as a baseline: if a noun has one sense, use it; otherwise select at random among its senses.
    Results.
    Since both the algorithm and the baseline may involve random choices, evaluation involved multiple runs with different random seeds.
    Table 2 summarizes the results, taken over 10 runs, considering only ambiguous test cases.
    All differences between the means for algorithm and baseline were statistically
