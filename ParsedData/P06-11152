umerate these contexts.
			In contrast, kernel methods allow a convenient mechanism to implicitly work with a potentially infinite number of features which can robustly capture these range of contexts even when the data is noisy.Our system, KRISP (Kernel-based Robust Interpretation for Semantic Parsing), takes NL sentences paired with their formal meaning representations as training data.
			The productions of the formal MRL grammar are treated like semantic concepts.
			For each of these productions, a SupportVector Machine (SVM) (Cristianini and ShaweTaylor, 2000) classifier is trained using string sim ilarity as the kernel (Lodhi et al, 2002).
			Eachclassifier then estimates the probability of the production covering different substrings of the sen tence.
			This information is used to compositionally build a complete meaning representation (MR) of the sentence.Some of the previous work on semantic parsing has focused on fairly simple domains, primar ily, ATIS (Air Travel Information Service) (Price,1990)
