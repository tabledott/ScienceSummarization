te that probability models can improve the performance of knowledge-based syntactic and semantic processing in dealing with structural ambiguity and with unknown words.
    Though the probability model employed is not new, our empirical findings are novel.
    When a choice among alternative interpretations produced by a unification-based parser and semantic interpreter must be made, a simple context-free probability model reduced the error rate by a factor of two compared with using no model.
    It is well known that a unification parser can process an unknown word by collecting the assumptions it makes while trying to find an interpretation for a sentence.
    As a second result, we found that adding a context-free probability model improved the unification predictions of syntactic and semantic properties of an unknown word, reducing the error rate by a factor of two compared with no model.
    In Section 4, we report an experiment in learning case frame information of unknown verbs from examples.
