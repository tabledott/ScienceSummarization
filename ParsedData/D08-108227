th a discriminative reranking technique, achieves state-of-the-art performance when tested on standard benchmark corpora.
    In future, we would like to extend the current model to have a wider range of support of MR formalisms, such as the one with lambda-calculus support.
    We are also interested in investigating ways to apply the generative model to the inverse task: generation of a NL sentence that explains a given MR structure.
