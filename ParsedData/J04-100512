the same &#954; values.
    Although this behavior follows squarely from &#954;&#8217;s definition, it is at odds with using &#954; to assess a coding scheme.
    From both Example 3 and Example 4 we would like to conclude that the two coders are in substantial agreement, independent of the skewed prevalence of Accept with respect to Ack in Example 3.
    The role of prevalence in assessing &#954; has been subject to heated discussion in the medical literature (Grove et al. 1981; Berry 1992; Goldman 1992).
    The bias problem occurs in &#954;Co but not &#954;S&amp;C.
    For &#954;Co, P(E) is computed from each coder&#8217;s individual probabilities.
    Thus, the less two coders agree in their overall behavior, the fewer chance agreements are expected.
    But for a given value of P(A), decreasing P(E) will increase &#954;Co, leading to the paradox that &#954;Co increases as the coders become less similar, that is, as the marginal totals diverge in the contingency table.
    Consider two coders coding the u
