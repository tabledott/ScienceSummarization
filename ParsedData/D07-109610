			This includes the work of Roark and Bacchiani (2003), Flo rian et al (2004), Chelba and Acero (2004), Daume?
			and Marcu (2006), and Titov and Henderson (2006).
			Of these, Roark and Bacchiani (2003) and Titov and Henderson (2006) deal specifically with syntactic parsing.
			The second scenario assumes that there are no annotated resources in the target domain.
			This is a more realistic situation and is considerably more difficult.
			Recent work by McClosky et al (2006)and Blitzer et al (2006) have shown that the exis tence of a large unlabeled corpus in the new domain can be leveraged in adaptation.
			For this shared-task,we are assuming the latter setting ? no annotated re sources in the target domain.
			Obtaining adequate annotated syntactic resourcesfor multiple languages is already a challenging prob lem, which is only exacerbated when these resources must be drawn from multiple and diverse domains.
			As a result, the only language that could be feasibly
