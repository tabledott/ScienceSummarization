			The jump probability of Eqn 5 becomes P (bk|xk, uk, ?k?1) = ? ????

			Suppose the input is a phrase sequence a, b, c, the MJ-2 model (Fig 5) allows 6 possible reorderings:a, b, c; a, c, b; b, a, c; b, c, a; c, a, b; c, b, a. The distri bution Eqn 9 ensures that the sequences b, c, a andc, b, a are assigned equal probability.
			The distribu tions in Eqns 10-12 ensure that th
