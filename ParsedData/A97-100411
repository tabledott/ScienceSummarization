r languages for which there are either POS tag lexica or POS tag annotated corpora that could be used to train automatic taggers.
    In comparison, our system does not require POS ta.gs or any supporting resources beyond the sentence-boundary annotated corpus.
    It is therefore easy and inexpensive to retrain this system for different genres of text in English and text in other Roman-alphabet languages.
    Furthermore, we showed tha.t a small training corpus is sufficient for good performance, and we estimate that annotating enough data to achieve good performance would require only several hours of work, in comparison to the many hours required to generate POS tag and lexical probabilities.
  
  
    We would like to thank David Palmer for giving us the test data he and Marti Hearst used for their sentence detection experiments.
    We would also like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful insights.
