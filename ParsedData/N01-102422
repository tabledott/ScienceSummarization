 particular &#8212; is to convey syntactic information, there is no guarantee that two words that are morphological variants need to share similar semantic properties.
    This suggests that performance could improve if the induction process took advantage of local, syntactic contexts around words in addition to the more global, large-window contexts used in semantic processing. a randomly-chosen set of words from the corpus as well as for each of the PPMVs of the ruleset that are not yet validated.
    Lastly, compute the NCS and their corresponding probabilities (see equation 1) between the ruleset&#8217;s signatures and those of the tobe-validated PPMVs to see if they can be validated.
    Table 3 gives an example of the kinds of contextual words one might expect for the &#8220;-s&lt;L&#8221; rule.
    In fact, the syntactic signature for &#8220;-s&lt;L&#8221; does indeed include such words as are, other, these, two, were, and have as indicators of words that occur on the left-hand side of the ruleset, and
