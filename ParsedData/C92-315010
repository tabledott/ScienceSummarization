 only the "place" of the units in the surface sequence is taken into account and not their position (cf [Milner 1989]) in a syntactic structure.
  This is why it is more accurate to speak of a surface grammatical analysis than of a complete syntactic analysis.
  The quality of the results obtained by the present prototype justify the non-necessity of a complete syntactic analysis.
  The advantages of restricting the analysis to surface structure are obvious : the program can deal with texts written in styles that are not necessarily academic; it is sturdy and quick, not negligible virtues when it come to the development and extension stages.
  Although it is not necessary to go into a complete syntactic analysis of the sentences to extract he terminology from a corpus, it would seem highly likely that a syntactic analyser (parser) would be much more efficient if it could use a glossary of the terminological units of the subject area.
  The syntactic structures of a natural language text, and the syntactic str
