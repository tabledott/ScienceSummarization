ming different tasks.
    The PARADISE performance measure is a function of both task success (K) and dialogue costs (ci), and has a number of advantages.
    First, it allows us to evaluate performance at any level of a dialogue, since K and ci can be calculated for any dialogue subtask.
    Since performance can be measured over any subtask, and since dialogue strategies can range over subdialogues or the whole dialogue, we can associate performance with individual dialogue strategies.
    Second, because our success measure K takes into account the complexity of the task, comparisons can be made across dialogue tasks.
    Third, K allows us to measure partial success at achieving the task.
    Fourth, performance can combine both objective and subjective cost measures, and specifies how to evaluate the relative contributions of those costs factors to overall performance.
    Finally, to our knowledge, we are the first to propose using user satisfaction to determine weights on factors related to performance
