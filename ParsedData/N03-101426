sociated node.
    The first four lines show the performance when this replacement is performed individually for each of the history representations input to the computation of a new history representation, namely that for the node&#8217;s left-corner ancestor, its most recent child, its left-corner child, and the previous parser action at the node itself, respectively.
    The final line shows the performance when all these replacements are done.
    In the first two models this replacement has the effect of imposing a hard independence assumption in place of the soft biases towards ignoring structurally more distant information.
    This is because there is no other series of history representations through which the removed information could pass.
    In the second two models this replacement simply removes the bias towards paying attention to more structurally local information, without imposing any independence assumptions.
    In each modified model there is a reduction in performance, as compared to th
