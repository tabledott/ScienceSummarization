lassification accuracies resulting from using only unigrams as features are shown in line (1) of Figure 3.
    As a whole, the machine learning algorithms clearly surpass the random-choice baseline of 50%.
    They also handily beat our two human-selected-unigram baselines of 58% and 64%, and, furthermore, perform well in comparison to the 69% baseline achieved via limited access to the test-data statistics, although the improvement in the case of SVMs is not so large.
    On the other hand, in topic-based classification, all three classifiers have been reported to use bagof-unigram features to achieve accuracies of 90% and above for particular categories (Joachims, 1998; Nigam et al., 1999)9 &#8212; and such results are for settings with more than two classes.
    This provides suggestive evidence that sentiment categorization is more difficult than topic classification, which corresponds to the intuitions of the text categorization expert mentioned above.10 Nonetheless, we still wanted to investigate ways t
