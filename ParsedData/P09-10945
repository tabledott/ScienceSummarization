 becomes the major limitation of the method.
    To address this problem, we have tried combining multiple resources to improve the SMT-based PG model (Zhao et al., 2008a).
    There have been researchers trying to propose uniform PG methods for multiple applications.
    But they are either rule-based (Murata and Isahara, 2001; Takahashi et al., 2001) or thesaurusbased (Bolshakov and Gelbukh, 2004), thus they have some limitations as stated above.
    Furthermore, few of them conducted formal experiments to evaluate the proposed methods.
  
  
    Despite the similarity between PG and MT, the statistical model used in SMT cannot be directly The SPG method proposed in this work contains three components, i.e., sentence preprocessing, paraphrase planning, and paraphrase generation (Figure 1).
    Sentence preprocessing mainly includes POS tagging and dependency parsing for the input sentences, as POS tags and dependency information are necessary for matching the paraphrase pattern and collocation resources in
