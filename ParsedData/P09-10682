t of roles (Grenager and Manning, 2006) and often a hand-labeled seed corpus (Swier and Stevenson, 2004; He and Gildea, 2006).
    In this paper, we describe our attempts to learn script-like information about the world, including both event structures and the roles of their participants, but without pre-defined frames, roles, or tagged corpora.
    Consider the following Narrative Schema, to be defined more formally later.
    The events on the left follow a set of participants through a series of connected events that constitute a narrative: Being able to robustly learn sets of related events (left) and frame-specific role information about the argument types that fill them (right) could assist a variety of NLP applications, from question answering to machine translation.
    Our previous work (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008) relied on the intuition that in a coherent text, any two events that are about the same participants are likely to be part of the same story or narrative.
