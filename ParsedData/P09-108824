imize BLEU on the MT02 test set (Och, 2003).
    To evaluate whether the approximate distributed inference algorithm described in Section 4.4 is effective, we compare the posterior probability of the training corpus when using a single machine, and when the inference is distributed on an eight core machine.
    Figure 6 plots the mean posterior and standard error for five independent runs for each scenario.
    Both sets of runs performed hyperparameter inference every twenty passes through the data.
    It is clear from the training curves that the distributed approximation tracks the corpus probability of the correct sampler sufficiently closely.
    This concurs with the findings of Newman et al. (2007) who also observed very little empirical difference between the sampler and its distributed approximation.
    Tables 3 and 4 show the result on the two NIST corpora when running the distributed sampler on a single 8-core machine.5 These scores tally with our initial hypothesis: that the hierarchical structu
