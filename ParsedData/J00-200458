l were sorted by the scores in Equation 36.
    Figure 7 shows the distribution of these scores on a log scale.
    The log scale helps to illustrate the plateaus in the curve.
    The longest plateau represents the set of word pairs that were linked once out of one co-occurrence (1/1) in the bitext.
    All these word pairs were equally likely to be correct.
    The second-longest plateau resulted from word pairs that were linked twice out of two co-occurrences (2/2) and the third longest plateau is from word pairs that were linked three times out of three co-occurrences (3/3).
    As usual, the entries with higher scores were more likely to be correct.
    By discarding entries with lower scores, coverage could be traded for accuracy.
    This trade-off was measured at three points, representing cutoffs at the end of each of the three longest plateaus.
    The traditional method of measuring coverage requires knowledge of the correct link types, which is impossible to determine without a gold standard.
