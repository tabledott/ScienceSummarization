  Automatic sense prediction for implicit discourse relations in text
  
    We present a series of experiments on auidentifying the sense of imrelations, i.e. relations that are not marked with a discourse connective such as &#8220;but&#8221; or &#8220;because&#8221;.
    We work with a corpus of implicit relations present in newspaper text and report results on a test set that is representative of the naturally occurring distribution of senses.
    We use several linguistically informed features, including polarity tags, Levin verb classes, length of verb phrases, modality, context, and lexical features.
    In addition, we revisit past approaches using lexical pairs from unannotated text as features, explain some of their shortcomings and propose modifications.
    Our best combination of features outperforms the baseline from data intensive approaches by 4% for comparison and 16% for contingency.
  
  
    Implicit discourse relations abound in text and readers easily recover the sense of such relations
