epresent a relation).
    In some cases, it is obvious how to reformulate a semantic problem in the new framework.
    Other tasks can be reframed in terms of our four semantic spaces using geometric operations such as centroid computations and projection onto a subspace.
    This was the case for selectional preferences, pattern- and example-based relation extraction (illustrated by qualia harvesting), and the task of generating typical properties of concepts.
    We consider a further strength of the DM approach that it naturally encourages us to think, as we did in these cases, of ways to tackle apparently unrelated tasks with the existing resources, rather than devising unrelated approaches to deal with them.
    Regarding point (2), that is, addressing a large battery of semantic experiments with good performance, in nearly all test sets our best implementation of DM (TypeDM) is at least as good as other algorithms reported in recently published papers (typically developed or tuned for the task at hand),
