ay that our annotation process has introduced almost as much structural information into NPs as there was in the original Penn Treebank.
    Table 3 shows the most common POS tag sequences for NP, NML and JJP nodes.
    An example is given showing typical words that match the POS tags.
    For NML and JJP, we also show the words bracketed, as they would appear under an NP node.
    We checked the consistency of the annotations by identifying NPs with the same word sequence and checking whether they were always bracketed identically.
    After the first pass through, there were 360 word sequences with multiple bracketings, which occurred in 1923 NP instances.
    489 of these instances differed from the majority case for that sequence, and were probably errors.
    The annotator had marked certain difficult and commonly repeating NPs.
    From this we generated a list of phrases, and then made another pass through the corpus, synchronising all instances that contained one of these phrases.
    After this, only
