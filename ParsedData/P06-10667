eordering model Q, we define it on the two consecutive blocks A1 and A2 and their order Under this framework, different reordering models can be designed.
    In fact, we defined four reordering models in our experiments.
    The first one is NONE, meaning no explicit reordering features at all.
    We set n to 1 for all different pairs of blocks and their orders.
    So the phrasal reordering is totally dependent on the language model.
    This model is obviously different from the monotone search, which does not use the inverted rule at all.
    The second one is a distortion style reordering model, which is formulated as where |AZ |denotes the number of words on the source side of blocks.
    When an &lt; 0, this design will penalize those non-monotone translations.
    The third one is a flat reordering model, which assigns probabilities for the straight and inverted order.
    It is formulated as In our experiments on Chinese-English tasks, the probability for the straight order is set at pm = 0.95.
