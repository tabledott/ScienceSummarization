labeled &#8220;Gold Tags&#8221;), the edit detector was the one described in Section 2 trained and tested on the part-ofspeech tags as specified in the gold standard trees.
    Note that the parser was not given the gold standard part-of-speech tags.
    We were interested in contrasting the results of this experiment with that of the third experiment to gauge what improvement one could expect from using a more sophisticated tagger as input to the edit detector.
    In the third experiment (&#8220;Machine Tags&#8221;) we used the edit detector based upon the machine generated tags.
    The results of the experiments are given in Table 3.
    The last line in the figure indicates the performance of this parser when trained and tested on Wall Street Journal text [3].
    It is the &#8220;Machine Tags&#8221; results that we consider the &#8220;true&#8221; capability of the detector/parser combination: 85.3% precision and 86.5% recall.
    The general trends of Table 3 are much as one might expect.
