sure shows the actual paths found through WordNet, while the tracing for lesk shows the gloss overlaps in WordNet found for the two concepts and their nearby relatives.
    The vector tracing shows the word vectors that are used to create the gloss vector of a concept.
  
  
    Similarity.pm is the super class of all modules, and provides general services used by all of the measures such as validation of synset identifier input, tracing, and caching of results.
    There are four modules that provide all of the functionality required by any of the supported measures: PathFinder.pm, ICFinder.pm, DepthFinder.pm, and LCSFinder.pm.
    PathFinder.pm provides getAllPaths(), which finds all of the paths and their lengths between two input synsets, and getShortestPath() which determines the length of the shortest path between two concepts.
    ICFinder.pm includes the method IC(), which gets the information content value of a synset. probability() and getFrequency() find the probability and frequency count of a syn
