 and providing a debugging mechanism for new modules.
    Because GATE has a componentbased model, this allows for easy coupling and decoupling of the processors, thereby facilitating comparison of alternative configurations of the system or different implementations of the same module (e.g., different parsers).
    The availability of tools for easy visualisation of data at each point during the development process aids immediate interpretation of the results.
    The GATE framework comprises a core library (analogous to a bus backplane) and a set of reusable LE modules.
    The framework implements the architecture and provides (amongst other things) facilities for processing and visualising resources, including representation, import and export of data.
    The reusable modules provided with the backplane are able to perform basic language processing tasks such as POS tagging and semantic tagging.
    This eliminates the need for users to keep recreating the same kind of resources, and provides a good star
