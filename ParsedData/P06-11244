e scheme in the hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model.
    Our interpretation is more useful than past interpretations involving marginal constraints (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen and Goodman, 1998) or maximum-entropy models (Goodman, 2004) as it can recover the exact formulation of interpolated Kneser-Ney, and actually produces superior results.
    (Goldwater et al., 2006) has independently noted the correspondence between the hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model and interpolated Kneser-Ney, and conjectured improved performance in the hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model, which we verify here.
    Thus the contributions of this paper are threefold: in proposing a langauge model with excellent performance and the accompanying advantages of Bayesian probabilistic models, in proposing a novel and efficient inference scheme for the model, and in establishing the direct correspondence between interpolated Kneser-Ney and the Bayesian approach.
    We describe the Pitman-Yor process in Section 2, and propose th
