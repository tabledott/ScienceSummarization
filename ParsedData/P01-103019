rtest tour will correspond to the likeliest decoding.
    The distance we assign to each pair of hotels consists of some small piece of the Model 4 formula.
    The usual case is typified by the large black arrow in Figure 3.
    Because the destination hotel &#8220;not&#8221; sits on the border between cities NE and PAS, it corresponds to a partial alignment in which the word &#8220;not&#8221; has fertility two: If we assume that we have already paid the price for visiting the &#8220;what&#8221; hotel, then our interhotel distance need only account for the partial alignment concerning &#8220;not&#8221;: NULL-owned hotels are treated specially.
    We require that all non-NULL hotels be visited before any NULL hotels, and we further require that at most one NULL hotel visited on a tour.
    Moreover, the NULL fertility sub-formula is easy to compute if we allow only one NULL hotel to be visited:is simply the number of cities that hotel straddles, and is the number of cities minus one.
    This case is typifie
