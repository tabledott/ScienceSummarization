    Dagan (1992) constructs a procedure, which he refers to as RAPSTAT, for using statistically measured lexical preference patterns to reevaluate RAP's salience rankings of antecedent candidates.
    RAPSTAT assigns a statistical score to each element of a candidate list that RAP generates; this score is intended to provide a measure (relative to a corpus) of the preference that lexical semantic/pragmatic factors impose upon the candidate as a possible antecedent for a given pronoun.'
    14 Such a distance measure is reminiscent of Hobbs' (1978) tree search procedure.
    See Section 6.1 for a discussion of Hobbs' algorithm and its limitations.
    The results for IV confirm our suspicions from the training phase that matrix emphasis (rewarding NPs not contained in a subordinate clause) does not contribute significantly to successful resolution.
    15 Assume that P is a non-pleonastic and non-reflexive pronoun in a sentence such that RAP generates the non-empty
