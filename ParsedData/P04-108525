;t exploit (e.g. structural features and adjective polarity), and to the fact that the learning algorithm used in our experiments might be more accurate than decision trees in the given task.
    Second, the table corroborates the findings of (Hillard et al., 2003) that lexical information make the most helpful local features.
    Finally, we observe that by incorporating label-dependency features representing pragmatic influences, we further improve the performance (about 1% in Table 7).
    This seems to indicate that modeling label dependencies in our classification problem is useful.
  
  
    We have shown how identification of adjacency pairs can help in designing features representing pragmatic dependencies between agreement and disagreement labels.
    These features are shown to be informative and to help the classification task, yielding a substantial improvement (1.3% to reach a 86.9% accuracy in three-way classification).
    We also believe that the present work may be useful in other computation
