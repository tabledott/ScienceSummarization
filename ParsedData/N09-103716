t we introduced a new nested NP which contained the entire contents of the original NP except for the POS.
    The original NP label was then changed to PossNP.
    This change is motivated by the status of &#8217;s as a phrasal affix or clitic: It is the NP preceding &#8217;s that is structurally equivalent to other NPs, not the larger unit that includes &#8217;s.
    This change has the additional benefit in this context that more named entities will correspond to a single phrase in the parse tree, rather than a contiguous set of phrases.
    The data has been annotated with eighteen types of entities.
    Many of these entity types do not occur very often, and coupled with the relatively small amount of data, make it difficult to learn accurate entity models.
    Examples are work of art, product, and law.
    Early experiments showed that it was difficult for even our baseline named entity recognizer, based on a state-of-the-art CRF, to learn these types of entities.3 As a result, we decided to merge all
