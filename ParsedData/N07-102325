er the K&amp;M model: here, the latter model performs deletion with too little lexicosyntactic information, and accidentally removes certain modifiers that are sometimes, but not always, good candidates for deletions (e.g., ADJP in Sentence 2, PP in sentences 3 and 4).
    On the other hand, our model keeps these constituent intact.
    Finally, the fifth and last example is one of the only three cases (among the 32 sentences) where our model produced a sentence we judged clearly ungrammatical.
    After inspection, we found that our parser assigned particularly errorful trees to those inputs, which may partially explain these ungrammatical outputs.
  
  
    A relatively large body of work addressed the problem of sentence compression.
    One successful recent approach (McDonald, 2006) combines a discriminative framework with a set of features that capture information similar to the K&amp;M model.
