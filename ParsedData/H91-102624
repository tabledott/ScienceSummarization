re for a selected pair must be significantly greater than the ?2 measures for each of the words of the pair and any other suggested translation.
  The iteration is accompanied by a progressive enlargement of possibly interesting pairs.
  We could not study all paks of words, or even all occurring pairs of words.
  Rather we take all the oceuring pairs in a progressively enlarged sample of regions.
  This does propose the most frequently cooccurring pairs first.
  On each iteration we delete the pairs of words that have already been selected, thereby reducing the confusion among collocates.
  Our eantion was expressed by hand checking the accuracy of selected pairs after each iteration.
  We chose techniques which could give 98 percent accuracy on the selected pairs.
  This has not been a blind automatic procedure, but one controlled at each step by human expertise.
  When we observed that many of the pairs considered contained morphological variants of a pair selected, we allowed such pairs to be accepted if
