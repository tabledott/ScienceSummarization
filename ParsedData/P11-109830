 a corpus contains.
    Recent work in Open IE learns atomic relations (Banko et al., 2007b), but little work focuses on structured scenarios.
    We learned more templates than just the main MUC-4 templates.
    A user who seeks to know what information is in a body of text would instantly recognize these as key templates, and could then extract the central entities.
    We hope to address in the future how the algorithm&#8217;s unsupervised nature hurts recall.
    Without labeled or seed examples, it does not learn as many patterns or robust classifiers as supervised approaches.
    We will investigate new text sources and algorithms to try and capture more knowledge.
    The final experiment in figure 7 shows that perhaps new work should first focus on pattern learning and entity extraction, rather than document identification.
    Finally, while our pipelined approach (template induction with an IR stage followed by entity extraction) has the advantages of flexibility in development and efficiency, it do
