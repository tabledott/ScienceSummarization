ocal model is not able to represent the count of arguments since the label of each node is decided independently.
    This feature can very directly and succinctly encode preferences for required arguments and expected number of arguments.
    As previously observed (Pradhan et al. 2004), including modifying arguments in sequence features is not helpful.
    This corresponds to the standard linguistic understanding that there are no prevalent constraints on the position or presence of adjuncts in an argument frame, and was confirmed in our experiments.
    We redefined the whole label sequence features to exclude modifying arguments.
    The whole label sequence features are the first type of features we add to relax the independence assumptions of the local model.
    Because these features look at the sequence of labels of all arguments, they capture joint information.
    There is no limit on the length of the label sequence and thus there is no n-gram Markov order independence assumption (in practice the
