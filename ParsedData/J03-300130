 as a starting point, Frank Keller and Mirella Lapata examine how useful the Web is as a source of frequency information for rare items: specifically, for dependency relations involving two English words such as &lt;fulfill OBJECT obligation&gt;.
    They generate pairs of common words, constructing combinations that are and are not attested in the BNC.
    They then compare the frequency of these combinations in a larger 325-million-word corpus and on the Web.
    They find that Web frequency counts are consistent with those for other large corpora.
    They also report on a series of human-subject experiments in which they establish that Web statistics are good at predicting the intuitive plausibility of predicate-argument pairs.
    Other experiments discussed in their article show that Web counts correlate reliably with counts re-created using class-based smoothing and overcome some problems of data sparseness in the BNC.
    Other very large corpora are available for English (English is an exception), an
