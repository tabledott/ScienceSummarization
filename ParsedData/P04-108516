 A in his or her next speech addressing A. for which exists, then a tag is influenced by and ; an example of such an influence is a case where speaker first agrees with , then speaker disagrees with , from which one could possibly conclude that is actually in disagreement with .
    Table 4 presents the results of our empirical evaluation of the first three assumptions.
    For comparison, the distribution of classes is the following: 18.8% are agreements, 10.6% disagreements, and 70.6% other.
    The dependencies empirically evaluated in the two last columns are non-local; they create dependencies between spurts separated by an arbitrarily long time span.
    Such long range dependencies are often undesirable, since the influence of one spurt on the other is often weak or too difficult to capture with our model.
    Hence, we made a Markov assumption by limiting context to an arbitrarily chosen value .
    In this analysis subsection and for all classification results presented thereafter, we used a value of
