    This strategy is implemented in the algorithm below.
    Compute the model psuf using Algorithm 1 Compute the gain in the log-likelihood from adding this feature using (23) One issue left unaddressed by this algorithm is the termination condition.
    Obviously, we would like a condition which applies exactly when all the &amp;quot;useful&amp;quot; features have been selected.
    One reasonable stopping criterion is to subject each proposed feature to cross-validation on a sample of data withheld from the initial data set.
    If the feature does not lead to an increase in likelihood of the withheld sample of data, the feature is discarded.
    We will have more to say about the stopping criterion in Section 5.3.
    Algorithm 2 is not a practical method for incremental feature selection.
    For each candidate feature f E .T. considered in step 2, we must compute the maximum entropy model p a task that is computationally costly even with the efficient iterative scaling algorithm 'introduced earlier.
