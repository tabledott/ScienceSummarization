ses readily available in the input, instead of generating every phrase from scratch.
    This makes the generation process more complex and thus prone to error.
    While the initial experiments conducted on a set of manually constructed themes seemed promising, the system performance deteriorated significantly when it was applied to automatically constructed themes.
    Our experience led us to believe that transformation of an arbitrary sentence into a FUF/SURGE input representation is similar in its complexity to semantic parsing, a challenging problem in its own right.
    Rather than refining the mapping mechanism, we modified MultiGen to use a statistical linearization component, which handles uncertainty and noise in the input in a more robust way.
  
  
    In our previous work, we evaluated the overall summarization strategy of MultiGen in multiple experiments, including comparisons with human-written summaries in the Document Understanding Conference (DUC)11 evaluation (McKeown et al. 2001; McKeown
