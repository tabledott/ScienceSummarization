is, characterization of the analysis trees of the expres- sions in the language (Kroch and Joshi, 1985; Kroch, 1989)) Among these properties are that o The domain of locality in TAGs is larger than lot formalisms lhat augment context-free grammars (such as lexical-functkmal, or generalized or head- driven phrase-structure grammar), and ? The statements of dependencies and recursion pos- sibilities in a tree are factored, the former following from primitive dependencies in elementary trees, the latter a consequence of an operatkm of adjunc- tion of trees.
			These unique properties of TAGs present a challenge tot the application of TAGs beyond the limited confines of syntax, for instance, to the task of semantic interpre- tation or automatic tr~mslation of natural anguage.
			The slandm'd methods of moving beyond syntax to interpre- tation make use in one way or another of the compo- sitional structure of the analysis tree that is manifested in the tree's derivation.
