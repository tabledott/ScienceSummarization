her conceptual roles (Fillmore 1976).
  The project methodology has proceeded on a frame-by-frame basis, that is, by first choosing a semantic frame (e.g., Commerce), defining the frame and its participants or frame elements (BUYER, GOODS, SELLER, MONEY), listing the various lexical predicates which invoke the frame (buy, sell, etc.
  ), and then finding example sentences of each predicate in a corpus (the British National Corpus was used) and annotating each frame element in each sentence.
  The example sentences were chosen primarily to ensure coverage of all the syntactic realizations of the frame elements, and simple examples of these realizations were preferred over those involving complex syntactic structure not immediately relevant to the lexical predicate itself.
  Only sentences in which the lexical predicate was used ?
  were annotated.
  A word with multiple distinct senses would generally be analyzed as belonging to different frames in each sense but may only be found in the FrameNet corpus in the
