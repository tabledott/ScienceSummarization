teworthy that systems did not seem to attempt the kind of joint inference that could make use of the full potential of various layers available in OntoNotes, but this could well have been owing to the limited time available for the shared task.
    &#8226; We had expected to see more attention paid to event coreference, which is a novel feature in this data, but again, given the time constraints and given that events represent only a small portion of the total, it is not surprising that most systems chose not to focus on it. versions of the CEAF metric &#8211; which tries to capture the goodness of the entities in the output &#8211; seem much lower than the other metric, though it is not clear whether that means that our systems are doing a poor job of creating coherent entities or whether that metric is just especially harsh.
    Finally, it is interesting to note that the problem of coreference does not seem to be following the same kind of learning curve that we are used to with other problems of this sort
