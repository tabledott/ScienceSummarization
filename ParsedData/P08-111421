-labels+ were similar to that of the undifferentiated constituency feature, XP+ achieved the highest gain.
    Intuitively, this seems plausible: the feature says, at least for Chinese, that a translation hypothesis should incur a penalty if it is translating a substring as a unit when that substring is not a canonical source constituent.
    Having obtained positive results with Chinese, we explored the extent to which the approach might improve translation using a very different source language.
    The approach on Arabic-English translation yielded large BLEU gains over baseline, as well as significant improvements over the undifferentiated constituency feature.
    Comparing the two sets of experiments, we see that there are definitely language-specific variations in the value of syntactic constraints; for example, AdvP, the top performer in Arabic, cannot possibly perform well for Chinese, since in our parses the AdvP constituents rarely include more than a single word.
