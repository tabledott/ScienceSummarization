 ( CPERSON -OBJ))), there is no added contribution for extraction by pattern matching with A (since all the matches with pattern A must be covered with pattern B).
    Therefore, we need to pay special attention to the ranking function for pattern candidates, so that patterns with more relevant contexts get higher score.
  
  
    This section discusses an automatic procedure to learn extraction patterns.
    Given a narrative description of the scenario and a set of source documents, the following three stages obtain the relevant extraction patterns for the scenario; preprocessing, document retrieval, and ranking pattern candidates.
    Morphological analysis and Named Entities (NE) tagging are performed at this stage.7 Then all the sentences are converted into dependency trees by an appropriate dependency analyzer.$ The NE tagging dure, from lexicalized dependency to chunk-level dependency.
    For the following experiment in Japanese, we define a node in replaces named entities by their class, so the resul
