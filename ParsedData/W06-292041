tion of nonprojective arcs/parsing units.
    It would be interesting to derive a formula based on those factors that fits the shared task data and see how well it predicts results on new data sets.
    One factor that seems to be irrelevant is the head-final versus head-initial distinction, as both the &#8220;easiest&#8221; and the most difficult data sets are for head-final languages.
    There is also no clear proof that some language families are easier (with current parsing methods) than others.
    It would be interesting to test parsers on the Hebrew treebank (Sima&#8217;an et al., 2001), to compare performance to Arabic, the other Semitic language in the shared task, or on the Hungarian Szeged Corpus (Csendes et al., 2004), for another agglutinative language.
    For most parsers, their ranking for a specific language differs at most a few places from their overall ranking.
    There are some outliers though.
    For example, Johansson and Nugues (2006) and Yuret (2006) are seven ranks higher for Turk
