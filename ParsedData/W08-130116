 suitable representation for users as well as a tool that is easy to use.
    Sagae et al. (2008) note that the availability of an automatic procedure to convert phrase structure parses to SD is the reason for its use in evaluations of parsers in the biomedical domain.
    The primary focus of the SD scheme, however, has been to offer grammatical relations appropriate for end-users.
    The Stanford parser4 comes with a tool, described in (de Marneffe et al., 2006), which provides for the rapid extraction of the grammatical relations from phrase structure parses.
    Structural configurations are used to define grammatical roles: the semantic head of each constituent of the parse is identified, using rules akin to the Collins head rules, but modified to retrieve the semantic head of the constituent rather than the syntactic head.
    As mentioned, content words are chosen as heads, and all the other words in the constituent depend on this head.
    To retrieve adequate heads from a semantic point of view, heu
