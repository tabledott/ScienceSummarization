at the more complex cases, where path information could make a difference, are beyond the reach of the parser in most cases.
    However, if we consider precision, recall and Fmeasure on non-projective dependencies only, as shown in Table 6, some differences begin to emerge.
    The most informative scheme, Head+Path, gives the highest scores, although with respect to Head the difference is not statistically significant, while the least informative scheme, Path &#8211; with almost the same performance on treebank transformation &#8211; is significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01).
    On the other hand, given that all schemes have similar parsing accuracy overall, this means that the Path scheme is the least likely to introduce errors on projective arcs.
    The overall parsing accuracy obtained with the pseudo-projective approach is still lower than for the best projective parsers.
    Although the best published results for the Collins parser is 80% UAS (Collins, 1999), this parser reaches 82% when trained on the e
