			For TempEval task C, one extra attribute is added: mainevent, with possible values YES and NO.
			? TLINK.
			This is a simplified version of the TimeML TLINK tag.
			The relation types for the TimeML version form a fine-grained set based on James Allen?s interval logic (Allen, 1983).
			For TempEval, we use only six relation typesincluding the three core relations BEFORE, AFTER, and OVERLAP, the two less specific relations BEFORE-OR-OVERLAP and OVERLAP OR-AFTER for ambiguous cases, and finally therelation VAGUE for those cases where no partic ular relation can be established.
			As stated above the TLINKs of concern for each task are explicitly included in the training and in thetest data.
			However, in the latter the relType at tribute of each TLINK is set to UNKNOWN.
			For each task the system must replace the UNKNOWN values with one of the six allowed values listed above.
