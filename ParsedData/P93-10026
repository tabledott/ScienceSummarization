he above framework is not amenable to the situation where a French sentence corresponds to no English sentences.
    Hence, we use a slightly different framework.
    We view a bilingual corpus as a sequence of sentence beads (Brown et al., 1991b), where a sentence bead corresponds to an irreducible group of sentences that align with each other.
    For example, the correct alignment of the bilingual corpus in Figure 2 consists of the sentence bead [Ei.
    ; Fd followed by the sentence bead [E2; F2, F3].
