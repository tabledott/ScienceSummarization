ably good performance.
    Table 1 is a sample relation that was extracted as a table by our system.
    The columns of the table show article dates, names of hurricanes and the places they affected respectively.
    The headers of the table and its keywords were also extracted automatically.
  
  
    In Unrestricted Relation Discovery, the discovery process (i.e. creating new tables) can be formulated as a clustering task.
    The key idea is to cluster a set of articles that contain entities bearing a similar relation to each other in such a way that we can construct a table where the entities that play the same role are placed in the same column.
    Suppose that there are two articles A and B, and both report hurricane-related news.
    Article A contains two entities &#8220;Katrina&#8221; and &#8220;New Orleans&#8221;, and article B contains &#8220;Longwang&#8221; and &#8220;Taiwan&#8221;.
    These entities are recognized by a Named Entity (NE) tagger.
    We want to discover a relation among them.
