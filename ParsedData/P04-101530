odel can be relaxed if the generative model score is included as another feature.
    In the current paper, the generative score was simply added as another feature.
    Another approach might be to use the generative model to produce candidates at a word, then assign perceptron features for those candidates.
    Such variants deserve investigation.
    Overall, these results show much promise in the use of discriminative learning techniques such as the perceptron algorithm to help perform heuristic search in difficult domains such as statistical parsing.
