s the appropriate analysis of unbounded dependencies in the hypothetical Scandinavian language Norwedish.
    He also argues that paired English complementizers may also require structural descriptions whose path sets have nested dependencies.
    Head Grammars (HG's), introduced by Pollard (1984), is a formalism that manipulates headed strings: i.e., strings, one of whose symbols is distinguished as the head.
    Not only is concatenation of these strings possible, but head wrapping can be used to split a string and wrap it around another string.
    The productions of HG's are very similar to those of CFG's except that the operation used must be made explicit.
    Thus, the tree sets generated by HG's are similar to those of CFG's, with each node annotated by the operation (concatenation or wrapping) used to combine the headed strings derived by the daughters of Tree Adjoining Grammars, a tree rewriting formalism, was introduced by Joshi, Levy and Takahashi (1975) and Joshi (1983/85).
