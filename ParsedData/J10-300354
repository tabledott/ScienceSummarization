phrases from such comparable corpora.
    The first method falls under category (a): Here the elements whose distributional similarity is being measured are paraphrastic patterns and the distributions themselves are the named entities with which the elements occur in various sentences.
    In contrast, the next two methods fall under category (b) and attempt to directly discover correspondences between two comparable corpora by leveraging a novel alignment algorithm combined with some similarity heuristics.
    The difference between the two latter methods lies only in the efficacy of the alignment algorithm.
    Shinyama et al. (2002) use two sets of 300 news articles from two different Japanese newspapers from the same day as their source of paraphrases.
    The comparable nature of the articles is ensured because both sets are from the same day.
    During pre-processing, all named entities in each article are tagged and dependency parses are created for each sentence in each article.
