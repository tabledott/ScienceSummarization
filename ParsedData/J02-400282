nd Kan&#8217;s, and to bottom-up clusters of verb similarities generated from our annotated data.
    The recognition of agents, which is already the second-best feature in the pool, could be further improved by including named entity recognition and anaphora resolution.
    Named entity recognition would help in cases like the following, LHIP provides a processing method which allows selected portions of the input to be ignored or handled differently.
    (S-5, 9408006) where LHIP is the name of the authors&#8217; approach and should thus be tagged as US AGENT; to do so, however, one would need to recognize it as a named approach, which is associated with the authors.
    It is very likely that such a treatment, which would have to include information from elsewhere in the text, would improve results, particularly as named approaches are frequent in the computational linguistics domain.
    Information about named approaches in themselves would also be an important aspect to include in summaries or citation
