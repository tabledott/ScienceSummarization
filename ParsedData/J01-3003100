3.9%, for which the best performance achieved by a human expert is 86.5%.
    Returning to our original questions of what can and need be learned about the relational properties of verbs, we conclude that argument structure is both a highly useful and learnable aspect of verb knowledge.
    We observe that relevant semantic properties of verb classes (such as causativity, or animacy of subject) may be successfully approximated through countable syntactic features.
    In spite of noisy data (arising from diverse sources such as tagging errors, or limitations of our extraction patterns), the lexical properties of interest are reflected in the corpora robustly enough to positively contribute to classification.
    We remark, however, that deep linguistic analysis cannot be eliminated&#8212;in our approach it is embedded in the selection of the features to count.
    Specifically, our features are derived through a detailed analysis of the differences in thematic role assignments across the verb classes under in
