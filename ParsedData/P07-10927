are naturally induced as part of our model, without extra processing effort.
    Furthermore, we improve the translation estimates for both seen and unseen phrase-table entries, whereas Callison-Burch et al. concentrate solely on unknown phrases.
    In contrast to Utiyama and Isahara (2007), we employ a large number of intermediate languages and demonstrate how triangulated phrase-tables can be combined with standard phrase-tables to improve translation output. une patate delicate une patate chaud une question delicate
  
  
    We start with a motivating example before formalising the mechanics of triangulation.
    Consider translating the English phrase a hot potato1 into French, as shown in Figure 2.
    In our corpus this English phrase occurs only three times.
    Due to errors in the word alignment the phrase was not included in the English-French phrase-table.
    Triangulation first translates hot potato into a set of intermediate languages (Dutch, Danish and Portuguese are shown in the figure), and
