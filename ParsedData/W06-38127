or role in weighted graphs.
    Apart from ties, the classes usually do not change any more after a handful of iterations.
    The number of iterations depends on the diameter of the graph: the larger the distance between two nodes is, the more iterations it takes to percolate information from one to another.
    The result of CW is a hard partitioning of the given graph into a number of partitions that emerges in the process &#8211; CW is parameter-free.
    It is possible to obtain a soft partitioning by assigning a class distribution to each node, based on the weighted distribution of (hard) classes in its neighborhood in a final step.
    The outcomes of CW resemble those of MinCut (Wu &amp; Leahy 1993): Dense regions in the graph are grouped into one cluster while sparsely connected regions are separated.
    In contrast to Min-Cut, CW does not find an optimal hierarchical clustering but yields a non-hierarchical (flat) partition.
    Furthermore, it does not require any threshold as input parameter and
