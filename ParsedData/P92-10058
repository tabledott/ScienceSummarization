the resolution says that the event occurred before a particular speech time, t7: sleep( term(+e,&lt;type=event&gt;, E'form(&lt;type=trel,tense=past&gt;, R-and(event(E),R(E)), and(event(E),precede(E,t7))), exists,+e), The resolution and ( event (E) , precede (E , t7) ) is the result of applying the form's restriction Vand(event (E),R(E)) to a contextually derived predicate, in this case E1-precede(E1,t7).
    QLF is not committed to an event based treatment of tense.
    An alternative that has also been implemented is to treat the verbal predication sleep( ...) as a temporal form, whose category specifies tense and aspect information.
    Ellipsis: A more complex example, involving ellipsis and quantification, is provided by Each boy claimed he was clever, and so did John.
    A partially resolved QLF, but one in which the ellipsis is still unresolved, might be as follows (ignoring tense and event variables): and( claim(term(+b,&lt;lex=every&gt;, boy,exists,+b), clever(term(+h,&lt;lex=he&gt;, male,exists,+b))
