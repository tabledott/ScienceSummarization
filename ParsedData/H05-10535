			We discuss the results with a proposal for applying the method to an all-words task, and an analysis of our results in terms of this proposal before concluding with future directions.
	
	
			We use the method described in McCarthy et al (2004) for finding predominant senses from raw text.
			The method uses a thesaurus obtained from the text by parsing, extracting grammatical relations and then listing each word (  ) with its top  nearest neighbours, where  is a constant.
			Like McCarthy 2This resource will be made publicly available for research purposes in the near future.
			et al (2004) we use   and obtain our thesaurus using the distributional similarity metric described by Lin (1998).
			We use WordNet (WN) as our sense inventory.
			The senses of a word  are each assigned a ranking score which sums over the distributional similarity scores of the neighbours and weights eachneighbour?s score by a WN Similarity score (Pat wardhan and Pedersen, 2003) between the sense of  and the
