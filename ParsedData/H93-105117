ns contain the responses of one classifier and the rows show a second classifiers responses in the same test set.
  This process constructs a square matrix whose di- agonal elements contain the number of test contexts on which the two methods agree.
  The results of the X ~ test for a three-sense resolution task (product,/orraation a d tezt), s indicate that the re- sponse pattern of the content vector classifier is very significantly different from the patterns of both the Bayesian and neural network classifiers, but the Bayesian response pattern is significantly different from the neural network pattern for only the product sense.
  In the six- sense disambiguation task, the X 2 results indicate that the Bayesian and neural network classifiers response patterns are not significantly different for any sense.
  The neural network and Bayesian classifiers response pat- terns are significantly different from the content vector classifier only in the formation and tezt senses.
