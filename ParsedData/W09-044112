idered for phrase substitutions.
    In addition, the cost for a phrasal substitution is limited to values greater than or equal to 0, i.e., the substitution cost cannot be negative.
    In addition, the shifting constraints of TERp are also relaxed to allow shifting of paraphrases, stems, and synonyms.
    In total TERp uses 11 parameters out of which four represent the cost of phrasal substitutions.
    The match cost is held fixed at 0, so that only the 10 other parameters can vary during optimization.
    All edit costs, except for the phrasal substitution parameters, are also restricted to be positive.
    A simple hill-climbing search is used to optimize the edit costs by maximizing the correlation of human judgments with the TERp score.
    These correlations are measured at the sentence, or segment, level.
    Although it was done for the experiments described in this paper, optimization could also be performed to maximize document level correlation &#8211; such an optimization would give decreased we
