    Existing methods for exploiting comparable corpora look for parallel data at the sentence level.
    However, we believe that very non-parallel corpora have none or few good sentence pairs; most of their parallel data exists at the sub-sentential level.
    As an example, consider Figure 1, which presents two news articles from the English and Romanian editions of the BBC.
    The articles report on the same event (the one-year anniversary of Ukraine&#8217;s Orange Revolution), have been published within 25 minutes of each other, and express overlapping content.
    Although they are &#8220;on-topic&#8221;, these two documents are non-parallel.
    In particular, they contain no parallel sentence pairs; methods designed to extract full parallel sentences will not find any useful data in them.
    Still, as the lines and boxes from the figure show, some parallel fragments of data do exist; but they are present at the sub-sentential level.
    In this paper, we present a method for extra
