 bilexical statistics suggest that generative models still have room for improvement through the employment of bilexical-class statistics, that is, dependencies among head-modifier word classes, where such classes may be defined by, say, WordNet synsets.
    Such dependencies might finally be able to capture the semantic preferences that were thought to be captured by standard bilexical statistics, as well as to alleviate the sparse-data problems associated with standard bilexical statistics.
    This is the subject of our current research.
  
  
    This section contains tables for all parameter classes in Collins&#8217; Model 3, with appropriate modifications and additions from the tables presented in Collins&#8217; thesis.
    The notation is that used throughout this article.
    In particular, for notational brevity we use M(w, t)i to refer to the three items Mi, tMi, and wMi that constitute some fully lexicalized modifying nonterminal and similarly M(t)i to refer to the two items Mi and tMi that constit
