; .a, DI for each rule (X0 a, D) where D((X0 eat)) = S. For each vertex i do the following steps until no more items can be added: Predictor step: For each item ending at i of the formi [h, i, X0 a.X;3, DI and each rule of the form (X0 &#8212; -I, E) such that E((Xo cat)) = D((X; cat)), add an edge of the form e, X0 &#8212; El if this edge is not subsumed by another edge.
    Informally, this involves predicting top-down all rules whose left-hand-side category matches the category of some constituent being looked for.
    Completer step: For each item of the form [h, 1, .V0 &#8212; a., DI and each item of the form [y. h, X0 &#8212; E.] add the item 19,1, Xo Eu [X : D(X0)IJ if the unification succeeds' and this edge is not subsumed by another edge.' no edge will be added, i.e., if the subphrase is not of the appropriate category for Insertion Into the phrase being built.
    'One edge subsumes another edge if and only if the first three elements of the edges are identical and the fourth element of the first ed
