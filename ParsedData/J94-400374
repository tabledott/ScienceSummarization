aches were tested only on a small number of preselected words, further evaluation is necessary to predict the actual cost of their application to broad domains.
    The methods described below, on the other hand, rely on resources that were already available on a large scale, and it is therefore possible to estimate the expected cost of their broad application.
    7.2.3 Word Classification.
    Yarowsky (1992) proposes a method that completely avoids manual tagging of the training corpus.
    This is achieved by estimating parameters for classes of words rather than for individual word senses.
    In his work, Yarowsky considered the semantic categories defined in Roget's Thesaurus as classes.
    He then mapped (manually) each of the senses of an ambiguous word to one or several of the categories under which this word is listed in the thesaurus.
    The task of sense disambiguation thus becomes the task of selecting the appropriate category for each occurrence of an ambiguous word.&amp;quot; When estimating
