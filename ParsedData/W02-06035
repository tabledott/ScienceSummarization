ly discussed approaches consider only individual words without regard to their contexts, or to their semantic content.
    In a different approach, Schone and Jurafsky (2000) utilize the context of each term to obtain a semantic representation for it using LSA.
    The division to morphemes is then accepted only when the stem and stem+affix are sufficiently similar semantically.
    Their method is shown to improve on the performance of Goldsmith&#8217;s Linguistica on CELEX, a morphologically analyzed English corpus.
    In the related field of text segmentation, one can sometimes obtain morphemes.
    Some of the approaches remove spaces from text and try to identify word boundaries utilizing e.g. entropy-based measures, as in (Redlich, 1993).
    Word induction from natural language text without word boundaries is also studied in (Deligne and Bimbot, 1997; Hua, 2000), where MDL-based model optimization measures are used.
    Viterbi or the forward-backward algorithm (an EM algorithm) is used for improving
