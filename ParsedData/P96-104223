eter values for committee members from the posterior distribution given the current statistics.
    When the statistics for a parameter are insufficient, the variance of the posterior distribution of the estimates is large, and hence there will be large differences in the values of the parameter chosen for different committee members.
    Note that property 1 is not addressed when uncertainty in classification is only judged relative to a single model7 (as in, eg, (Lewis and Gale, 1994)).
    Property 2 is addressed by selecting examples for which committee members highly disagree in classification (rather than measuring disagreement in parameter estimates).
    Committee-based selection thus addresses properties 1 and 2 simultaneously: it acquires statistics just when uncertainty in current parameter estimates entails uncertainty regarding the appropriate classification of the example.
    Our results show that this effect is achieved even when using only two committee members to sample the space of likely c
