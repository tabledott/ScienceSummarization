  At the discourse level, just as at the utterance level, the intended recognition of intentions plays a central role.
    The DSPs are intended to be recognized: they achieve their effects, in part, because the OCP recognizes the ICP's intention for the OCP to 4, that p. The OCP's recognition of this intention is crucial to its achieving the desired effect.
    In Section 4 we described certain constraints on the recognition process.
    In extending Grice's analysis to the discourse level, we have to consider not only individual beliefs and intentions, but also the relationships among them that arise because of the relationships among various discourse segments (and utterances within a segment) and the purposes the segments serve with respect to the entire discourse.
    To clarify these relationships, consider an analogous situation with nonlinguistic actions.18 An action may divide into several subactions; for example, the planting of a rose bush divides into preparing the soil, digging a hole, placing th
