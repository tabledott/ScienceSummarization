hown to provide significant improvements in CRFs performance.
    In some experiments described below we use feature induction.
    The focus in this section is on three other aspects of the feature space.
    In CRFs, state transitions are also represented as features.
    The feature function fk(yt&#8722;1, yt, x, t) in Equ.
    (1) is a general function over states and observations.
    Different state transition features can be defined to form different Markov-order structures.
    We define four different state transitions features corresponding to different Markov order for different classes of features.
    Higher order features model dependencies better, but also create more data sparse problem and require more memory in training.
    Before the use of prior distributions over parameters was common in maximum entropy classifiers, standard practice was to eliminate all features with zero count in the training data (the so-called unsupported features).
    However, unsupported, zero-count features can b
