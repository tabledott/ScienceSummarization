Cl decrease the height of &#963;.
    Hence, the combined number of SHIFT and RIGHT-ARCel transitions, as well as the combined number of REDUCE and LEFT-ARCl transitions, are bounded by n. &#9632; Nivre Deterministic Incremental Dependency Parsing Theorem 6 The worst-case space complexity of the arc-eager, stack-based algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input sentence.
    Proof 6 Same as Proof 3.

    The list-based algorithms make use of two lists to store partially processed tokens, that is, tokens that have been removed from the input buffer but which are still considered as potential candidates for dependency links, either as heads or as dependents.
    A parser configuration is therefore defined as a quadruple, consisting of two lists, an input buffer, and a set of dependency arcs.
    The list &#955;1 has its head to the right and stores nodes in descending order, and the list &#955;2 has its head to the left and stores nodes in ascending order.
    Thus, &#955;1Ii represen
