, since all the words have to be tagged correctly for the sentence to be tagged correctly.
    The standard measure used in the literature is performance at word level, and this is the one considered here.
  
  
    In the probabilistic formulation of the tagging problem we assume that the alignments are generated by a probabilistic model according to a probability distribution: p(W, T) In this case, depending on the criterion that we choose for evaluation, the optimal tagging procedure is as follows: We call this procedure Viterbi tagging.
    It is achieved using a dynamic programming scheme. where 0(W), is the tag assigned to word w, by the tagging procedure in the context of the sentence W. We call this procedure Maximum It is interesting to note that the most commonly used method is Viterbi tagging (see DeRose 1988; Church 1989) although it is not the optimal method for evaluation at word level.
    The reasons for this preference are presumably that: However, in our experiments, we will show that Viterb
