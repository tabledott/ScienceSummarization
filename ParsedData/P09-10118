tasets.
    In this domain, each scenario represents a single NFL football game (see Figure 1(c) for an example).
    The world state (the things that happened during the game) is represented by database tables, e.g., scoring summary, team comparison, drive chart, play-by-play, etc.
    Each record is a database entry, for instance, the receiving statistics for a certain player.
    The text is the recap of the game&#8212; an article summarizing the game highlights.
    The dataset we used was collected by Barzilay and Lapata (2005).
    The data includes 466 games during the 2003&#8211;2004 NFL season.
    78 of these games were annotated by Snyder and Barzilay (2007), who aligned each sentence to a set of records.
    This domain is by far the most complicated of the three.
    Many records corresponding to inconsequential game statistics are not mentioned.
    Conversely, the text contains many general remarks (e.g., it was just that type of game) which are not present in any of the records.
