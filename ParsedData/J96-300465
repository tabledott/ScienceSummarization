    Can's solution depends upon a fairly sophisticated language model that attempts to find valid syntactic, semantic, and lexical relations between objects of various linguistic types (hanzi, words, phrases).
    An example of a fairly low-level relation is the affix relation, which holds between a stem morpheme and an affix morpheme, such as -men() (PL).
    A high-level relation is agent, which relates an animate nominal to a predicate.
    Particular instances of relations are associated with goodness scores.
    Particular relations are also consistent with particular hypotheses about the segmentation of a given sentence, and the scores for particular relations can be incremented or decremented depending upon
