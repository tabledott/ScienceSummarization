compare the accuracy of various configurations of our system on the ANC, AQT and MUC datasets (Table 5).
    We include the score from picking the noun immediately preceding the pronoun (after our hard filters are applied).
    Due to the hard filters and limited search window, it is not possible for our system to resolve every noun to a correct antecedent.
    We thus provide the performance upper bound (i.e. the proportion of cases with a correct answer in the filtered candidate list).
    On ANC and AQT, each of the probabilistic features results in a statistically significant gain in performance over a model trained and tested with that feature absent.5 On the smaller MUC set, none of the differences in 3-6 are statistically significant, however, the relative contribution of the various features remains reassuringly constant.
    Aside from missing antecedents due to the hard filters, the main sources of error include inaccurate statistical data and a classifier bias toward preceding pronouns of the same
