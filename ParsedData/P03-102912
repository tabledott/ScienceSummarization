document, and as random otherwise.
    Thus, we can get the performance of text classification of the pattern matching system in the form of a precision-recall curve, without any supervision.
    Next, the area of the precision-recall curve is computed by connecting every point in the precision-recall curve from 0 to the maximum recall the pattern matching system reached, and we compare the area for each possible value.
    Finally, the value which gets the greatest area under the precision-recall curve is used for extraction.
    The comparison to the same procedure based on the precision-recall curve of the actual extraction performance shows that this tuning has high correlation with the extraction performance (Spearman correlation coefficient with 2% confidence).
    For efficiency and to eliminate low-frequency noise, we filtered out the pattern candidates that appear in less than 3 documents throughout the entire collection.
    Also, since the patterns with too much context are unlikely to match with n
