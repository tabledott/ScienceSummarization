the correct transition based onthe current parser state and/or history.
			We can fur ther subclassify parsers with respect to the model (or transition system) they adopt, the inference method they use, and the learning method they employ.
			5.2.1 Models The most common model for transition-based parsers is one inspired by shift-reduce parsing, where a parser state contains a stack of partially processed tokens and a queue of remaining input tokens, and where transitions add dependency arcs and perform stack and queue operations.
			This type of model is used by the majority of transition-based parsers (Attardi et al, 2007; Duan et al, 2007; Hallet al, 2007a; Johansson and Nugues, 2007b; Man nem, 2007; Titov and Henderson, 2007; Wu et al, 2007).
			Sometimes it is combined with an explicit probability model for transition sequences, which may be conditional (Duan et al, 2007) or generative (Titov and Henderson, 2007).
			An alternative model is based on the list-based parsing algorithm described by Covington
