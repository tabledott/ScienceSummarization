ion rules.
    A simple context restriction rule is an expression of the form
  
  
    where r, A, and p denote subsets of 7r*.
    Usually T is just a single feasible pair, a singleton element of 7r, but this limitation has no mathematical significance.
    Either of the contexts A or p can be omitted, in which case it is taken to be &#8364;: e. Such a rule is interpreted as denoting a string relation whose members satisfy the following conditions: Every corresponding substring of a string pair that belongs to the relation T must be immediately preceded by a corresponding substring belonging to the leftcontext A and followed by one belonging to the right-context p. In other words, any appearance of T outside the specified contexts is illegal.
    Under this interpretation, the relation denoted by the rule would include the string pairs (cae, dbf) and (cae,cge), assuming that a:g is in it along with the symbol pairs mentioned in the rule.
    The first string pair is included because the pair a:b is properly
