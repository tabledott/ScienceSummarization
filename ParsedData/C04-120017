 performance).
			Since Model 0 considers not probabilities of words but only their polarities, the two word- level classifier equations yield the same results.
			Consequently, Model 0 has 8 combinations and Models 1 and 2 have 16 each.
			To test the identification of opinion Holder, we first ran models with holders that were annotated by humans then ran the same models with the automatic holder finding strategies.
			The results appear in Figures 2 and 3.
			The models are numbered as follows: m0 through m4 represent 4 sentence classifier models, Table 5.
