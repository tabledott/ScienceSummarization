    They have previously been explored for deterministic classifier-based parsing in Nivre (2006a, 2007).
    A more orthodox implementation of Covington&#8217;s algorithms for data-driven dependency parsing is found in Marinov (2007).
  
  
    In this article, we have introduced a formal framework for deterministic incremental dependency parsing, where parsing algorithms can be defined in terms of transition systems that are deterministic only together with an oracle for predicting the next transition.
    We have used this framework to analyze four different algorithms, proving the correctness of each algorithm relative to a relevant class of dependency graphs, and giving complexity results for each algorithm.
    To complement the formal analysis, we have performed an experimental evaluation of accuracy and efficiency, using SVM classifiers to approximate oracles, and using data from 13 languages.
    The comparison shows that although strictly projective dependency parsing is most efficient both in learn
