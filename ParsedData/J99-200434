roving it from 91% to 96-97%, a 5.5% improvement.
    In contrast, contextual information has greater effect on the performance of the supertagger.
    As can be seen, from the above experiments, the baseline performance of the supertagger is about 77% and the performance improves to about 92% with the inclusion of contextual information, an Bangalore and joshi Supertagging improvement of 19.5%.
    The relatively low baseline performance for the supertagger is a direct consequence of the fact that there are many more supertags per word than there are POS tags.
    Further, since many combinations of supertags are not possible, contextual information has a larger effect on the performance of the supertagger.
    In an error-driven transformation-based (EDTB) tagger (Brill 1993), a set of patternaction templates that include predicates that test for features of words appearing in the context of interest are defined.
    These templates are then instantiated with the appropriate features to obtain transformatio
