4 teams submitting final results (Kim et al., 2009).
    To establish a community effort, the organizers provided the task definition, benchmark data, and evaluations, and the participants competed in developing systems to perform the task.
    Meanwhile, participants and organizers communicated to develop a better setup of evaluation, and some provided their tools and resources for other participants, making it a collaborative competition.
    The final results enabled to observe the state-ofthe-art performance of the community on the bioevent extraction task, which showed that the automatic extraction of simple events - those with unary arguments, e.g. gene expression, localization, phosphorylation - could be achieved at the performance level of 70% in F-score, but the extraction of complex events, e.g. binding and regulation, was a lot more challenging, having achieved 40% of performance level.
    After BioNLP-ST 2009, all the resources from the event were released to the public, to encourage continuous e
