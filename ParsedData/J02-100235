 with probability 0.25. reasons described above, this means the results will not be skewed by the sensitivity of Pk and Pk to segment size variations.
    The tests analyzed below were performed using the high error occurrence probabilities of 0.5, but similar results were obtained using probabilities of 0.25 and 0.05 as well.
    The following error distributions were used:1 occurring at each point with probability p = number of segments corresponds to a 0.5 probability value for each individual segment); The results are shown in Table 3.
    Pk penalizes FP2 less than FP1 and FP3, and FNP2 less than FNP1 and FNP3.
    This result is as expected.
    FP2 and FNP2 have false positives normally distributed around each boundary, which means that more of the false positives are close to the boundaries and thus are penalized less.
    If we made the standard deviation smaller, we would expect this difference to be even more apparent.
    Pk penalized FP2 and FNP2 the least in their respective categories, and FP1
