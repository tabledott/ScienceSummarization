cture of a verb, we begin to see a richer notion of compositionality emerging, one that looks very much like object-oriented approaches to programming (cf.
    Ingria and Pustejovsky 1990).
    To illustrate these structures at play, let us consider a few examples.
    Assume that the decompositional semantics of a nominal includes a specification of its qualia structure: For example, a minimal semantic description for the noun novel will include values for each of these roles, as shown in Example 40, where *x* can be seen as a distinguished variable, representing the object itself.
    This structures our basic knowledge about the object: it is a narrative; typically in the form of a book; for the purpose of reading (whose event type is a transition); and is an artifact created by a transition event of writing.
    Observe how this structure differs minimally, but significantly, from the qualia structure for the noun dictionary in Example 41.
    Notice the differences in the values for the constitutive and
