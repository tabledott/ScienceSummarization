de of the parallel texts using the same number of training examples for each sense of w that are present in the manually sense-tagged SENSEVAL-2 official training corpus (lumped-sense version).
    If there are insufficient training examples for some sense of w from the parallel texts, then we just used as many parallel text training examples as we could find for that sense.
    We chose the same number of training examples for each sense as the official training data so that we can do a fair comparison between the accuracy of the parallel text alignment approach versus the manual sense-tagging approach.
    After training a WSD classifier for w with such parallel text examples, we then evaluated the WSD classifier on the same official SENSEVAL-2 test set (with lumped senses).
    The test accuracy of each noun obtained by training on such parallel text training examples (averaged over 10 trials) is listed in the column labeled P1 in Table 3.
    The baseline accuracy for each noun is also listed in the colum
