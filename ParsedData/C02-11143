ether in a particular category, such as vehicles or weapons (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) (Roarkand Charniak, 1998).
			Roark and Charniak de scribe a ?generic algorithm?
			for extracting suchlists of similar words using the notion of seman tic similarity, as follows (Roark and Charniak, 1998, ?1).
			1.
			For a given category, choose a small.
			set of exemplars (or ?seed words?)
			2.
			Count co-occurrence of words and.
			seed words within a corpus these counts to select new seed words 4.
			Return to step 2 and iterate n times.
			5.
			Use a figure of merit to rank words.
			for category membership and output a ranked list Algorithms of this type were used by Riloff and Shepherd (1997) and Roark and Charniak (1998), reporting accuracies of 17% and 35% respectively.
			Like the algorithm we present in Section 5, the similarity measure (or ?figure ofmerit?)
			used in these cases was based on co occurrence in lists.
			Both of these works evaluated their resultsby asking humans to judge whether items gene
