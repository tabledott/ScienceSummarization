based formalism), we cannot check for the &amp;quot;same label&amp;quot; (same lemma), because lemmas in general will contain variables.
    We must instead check for subsumption of the new lemma by some old lemma.
    The obvious subsumption checking mechanism has an o(n3) worst case cost, but the improved binding representations described above, together with the other special techniques mentioned in the previous section, can be used to reduce this cost in practice.
    We do not yet have a full complexity comparison between online and offline parsing, but it is easy to envisage situations in which the number of edges created by an online algorithm is much smaller than that for the corresponding offline algorithm, whereas the cost of applying the unification constraints is the same for both algorithms.
  
  
    We have outlined an approach to the problems of parsing unification-based grammar formalisms that builds on the relationship between parsing and definite-clause deduction.
    Several theoretical an
