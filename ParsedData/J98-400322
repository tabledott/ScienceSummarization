    When I look at an article in Russian, I say: &amp;quot;This is really written in English, but it has been coded in some strange symbols.
    I will now proceed to decode.&amp;quot; (p. 18) Whether this is a useful perspective for machine translation is debatable (Brown et al. 1993; Knoblock 1996)&#8212;however, it is a dead-on description of transliteration.
    Most katakana phrases really are English, ready to be decoded.
    We have presented a method for automatic back-transliteration which, while far from perfect, is highly competitive.
    It also achieves the objectives outlined in Section 1.
    It ports easily to new language pairs; the P(w) and P(ejw) models are entirely reusable, while other models are learned automatically.
    It is robust against OCR noise, in a rare example of high-level language processi
