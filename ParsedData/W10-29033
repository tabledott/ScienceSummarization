 consuming task; minimizing the supervision effort required for learning is a major challenge in scaling semantic parsers.
    This paper proposes a new model and learning paradigm for semantic parsing aimed to alleviate the supervision bottleneck.
    Following the observation that the target meaning representation is to be executed by a computer program which in turn provides a response or outcome; we propose a response driven learning framework capable of exploiting feedback based on the response.
    The feedback can be viewed as a teacher judging whether the execution of the meaning representation produced the desired response for the input sentence.
    This type of supervision is very natural in many situations and requires no expertise, thus can be supplied by any user.
    Continuing with Example 1, the response generated by executing a database query would be used to provide feedback.
    The feedback would be whether the generated response is the correct answer for the input question or not, in thi
