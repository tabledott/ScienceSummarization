 are mostly based on syntactic instead of semantic patterns.
    Since semantic patterns are more reliable than syntactic patterns across language families, we hoped that eliminating the function words would give our method more generality.
    We also decided to lemmatize our corpora.
    Since we were interested in the translations of base forms only, it was clear that lemmatization would be useful.
    It not only reduces the sparsedata problem but also takes into account that German is a highly inflectional language, whereas English is not.
    For both languages we conducted a partial lemmatization procedure that was based only on a morphological lexicon and did not take the context of a word form into account.
    This means that we could not lemmatize those ambiguous word forms that can be derived from more than one base form.
    However, this is a relatively rare case.
    (According to Lezius, Rapp, &amp; Wettler, 1998, 93% of the tokens of a German text had only one lemma.)
    Although we had a co
