ge sample from this sub-corpus.
			The compari son study described above used an OK sub-corpussample that was twice as large as the Error subcorpus sample (about 500 contexts vs. 250 con texts).
			In short, the sampling approach is intended to alleviate the burden on annotators when faced with the task of having to rate several thousand errors of a particular type in order to produce a sizeable error corpus.
			On the other hand, one advantage that exhaustive annotation has over the sampling method is that it makes possible the comparison of multiple systems.
			With the sampling approach, one would have to resample and annotate for each system, thus multiplying the work needed.
	
	
			One aspect of automatic error detection that usu ally is under-reported is an analysis of the errors that learners typically make.
			The obvious benefit of this analysis is that it can focus development of the system.
			From our annotated set of preposition errors, we found that the most common prepositions that learners use
