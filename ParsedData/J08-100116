d solely on the principle of continuity achieves competitive performance against more sophisticated alternatives when applied to ordering short descriptions of museum artifacts.1 In other applications, the ranking function is more complex, integrating rules from Centering Theory along with stylistic constraints (Kibble and Power 2004).
    A common feature of current implementations is that the specification of the ranking function&#8212;feature selection and weighting&#8212;is performed manually based on the intuition of the system developer.
    However, even in a limited domain this task has proven difficult.
    Mellish et al. (1998; page 100) note: &#8220;The problem is far too complex and our knowledge of the issues involved so meager that only a token gesture can be made at this point.&#8221; Moreover, these ranking functions operate over semantically rich input representations that cannot be created automatically without extensive knowledge engineering.
    The need for manual coding impairs the porta
