EK's E-set and 18.4% of the sample from its C-set.
    To estimate overall incorrect usage, we computed a weighted mean of these two rates, where the weights reflected the proportion of sentences that were in the E-set and C-set.
    The E-set contained 8.3% of the pollution sentences and the C-set had the remaining 91.7%.
    With the human judgements as the gold standard, the estimated overall rate of incorrect usage is (.083 x .912 + .917 x .184) = .245.
    ALEK's estimated recall is the proportion of sentences in the E-set times its precision, divided by the overall estimated error rate (.083 x .912) / .245 = .310.
    The precision results vary from word to word.
    Conclusion and pollution have precision in the low to middle 90's while individual's precision is 57%.
    Overall, ALEK's predictions are about 78% accurate.
    The recall is limited in part by the fact that the system only looks at syntactic information, while many of the errors are semantic.
