ck of space.
    This phonetic correspondence model can then be used to score putative transliteration pairs.
    Names of the same entity that occur in different languages often have correlated frequency patterns due to common triggers such as a major event.
    Thus if we have comparable news articles over a sufficiently long time period, it is possible to exploit such correlations to learn the associations of names in different languages.
    The idea of exploiting frequency correlation has been well studied.
    (See the previous work section.)
    We adopt the method proposed in (Tao and Zhai, 2005), which works as follows: We pool all documents in a single day to form a large pseudo-document.
    Then, for each transliteration candidate (both Chinese and English), we compute its frequency in each of those pseudo-documents and obtain a raw frequency vector.
    We further normalize the raw frequency vector so that it becomes a frequency distribution over all the time points (days).
    In order to comput
