wever, we see a large improvement from adding reranker-best sentences.
    One may expect to see a monotonic improvement from this technique, but this is not quite the case, as seen when we add 1,000k sentences.
    This may be due to some sections of NANC being less similar to WSJ or containing more noise.
    Another possibility is that these sections contains harder sentences which we cannot parse as accurately and thus are not as useful for self-training.
    For our remaining experiments, we will only use reranker-best lists.
    We also attempt to discover the optimal number of sentences to add from NANC.
    Much of the improvement comes from the addition of the initial 50,000 sentences, showing that even small amounts of new data can have a significant effect.
    As we add more data, it becomes clear that the maximum benefit to parsing accuracy by strictly adding rerankerbest sentences is about 0.7% and that f-scores will asymptote around 91.0%.
    We will return to this when we consider the relativ
