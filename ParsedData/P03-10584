thout manual annotation.
    However, are current word alignment algorithms accurate enough for our purpose?
    (iii) Ultimately, using a state-of-the-art supervised WSD program, what is its disambiguation accuracy when it is trained on a &#8220;sense-tagged&#8221; corpus obtained via parallel text alignment, compared with training on a manually sense-tagged corpus?
    Much research remains to be done to investigate all of the above issues.
    The lack of large-scale parallel corpora no doubt has impeded progress in this direction, although attempts have been made to mine parallel corpora from the Web (Resnik, 1999).
    However, large-scale, good-quality parallel corpora have recently become available.
    For example, six English-Chinese parallel corpora are now available from Linguistic Data Consortium.
    These parallel corpora are listed in Table 2, with a combined size of 280 MB.
    In this paper, we address the above issues and report our findings, exploiting the English-Chinese parallel corpora i
