e original annotation guidelines were not published, but in this work we recorded the rules governing tagging decisions and made further revisions while annotating the new data.12 Some of our guidelines reiterate or modify rules made by Penn Treebank annotators, while others treat specific phenomena found on Twitter (refer to the next section).
    Our tweets were annotated by two annotators who attempted to match the choices made in Gimpel et al.&#8217;s dataset.
    The annotators also consulted the POS annotations in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) as an additional reference.
    Differences were reconciled by a third annotator in discussion with all annotators.13 During this process, an inconsistency was found in Gimpel et al.&#8217;s data, which we corrected (concerning the tagging of this/that, a change to 100 labels, 0.4%).
    The new version of Gimpel et al.&#8217;s data (called OCT27), as well as the newer messages (called DAILY547), are both included in our data release.
