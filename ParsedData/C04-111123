precision and recall (six times) than the co-occurrence approach on the small 15MB dataset.
			In fact, only on the 150MB dataset did the co-occurrence system have higher recall.
			With datasets larger than 150MB, the co occurrence algorithm reduces its running time by filtering out grammatical relationships for words that occurred fewer than k = 40 times and hence recall is affected (in contrast, the pattern-based approach may generate a hyponym for a word that it only sees once).
			5.3.2 Definition questions Following Fleischman et al (2003), we select the 50 definition questions from the TREC2003 (Voorhees 2003) question set.
			These questions are of the form ?Who is X??
			and ?What is X??
			For each question (e.g., ?Who is Niels Bohr??, ?What is feng shui??)
			we extract its respective instance (e.g., ?Neils Bohr?
			and ?feng shui?), look up their corresponding hyponyms from our is-a table, and present the corresponding hyponym as the answer.
			We compare the results of both our systems with WordN
