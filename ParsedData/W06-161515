entences that have been annotated by humans as part of the Penn BioIE project (PennBioIE, 2005).
    We use the same 561sentence test set in all our experiments.
    The partof-speech tag set for this data is a superset of the Penn Treebank&#8217;s including the two new tags HYPH (for hyphens) and AFX (for common postmodifiers of biomedical entities such as genes).
    These tags were introduced due to the importance of hyphenated entities in biomedical text, and are used for 1.8% of the words in the test set.
    Any tagger trained only on WSJ text will automatically predict wrong tags for those words.
    Since SCL is really a method for inducing a set of cross-domain features, we are free to choose any feature-based classifier to use them.
    For our experiments we use a version of the discriminative online large-margin learning algorithm MIRA (Crammer et al., 2006).
    MIRA learns and outputs a linear classification score, s(x, y; w) = w &#183; f(x, y), where the feature representation f can contain arb
