elightful that the formula yields exactly what intuition would dictate in this case .
  COMPUTATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS, BRIEFLY EXPLORE D Our scoring expressions are easy to compute .
  The key step is the formation of equivalence classes, which can be accomplished by many algorithms .
  Tarjans classic UNION-FIND, to cite the obvious example, operates in time effectively linear with th e number of entities under consideration .
  This is substantially less expensive than enumerating the transitive closure of keys and answers, as is required by the origina l syntactic scoring procedure .
  Not often does attention to model theory yield efficient algorithms, but in this particular case the effort was well worth the while .
