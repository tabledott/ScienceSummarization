1) and Env(v2) respectively.
    To derive the algorithm, we consider the general case of a hyperedge e with rule re : X &#8212;* w1X1w2...wnXnwn+1.
    Because the right-hand side of re has n nonterminals, the arity of e is |e |= n. Let T(e) = {v1, ..., vn} denote the tail nodes of e. We now assume that each tail node vi E T(e) is associated with the upper envelope over all candidate translations that are induced by derivations of the corresponding nonterminal symbol Xi.
    These envelopes shall be deAlgorithm 2 V-operation (Max) input: array L[0..K-1] containing line objects output: upper envelope of L noted by Env(vi).
    To decompose the problem of computing and propagating the tail envelopes over the hyperedge e to its head node, we now define two operations, one for either node type, to specify how envelopes associated with the tail vertices are propagated to the head vertex.
    Nodes of Type &#8220;&#8743;&#8221;: For a type n node, the resulting envelope is the Minkowski sum over the envelopes of t
