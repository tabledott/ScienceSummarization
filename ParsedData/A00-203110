    The denominator of the accuracy measure should be the maximum possible number we could get correct.
    In this case, that means excluding those constituents that were already wrong in the parser output; the parser we used attains 89% labelled precision-recall, so roughly 11% of the constituents are excluded from the function tag accuracy evaluation.
    (For reference, we have also included the performance of our function tagger directly on treebank parses; the slight gain that resulted is discussed below.)
    Another consideration is whether to count non-tagged constituents in our evaluation.
    On the one hand, we could count as correct any constituent with the correct tag as well as any correctly non-tagged constituent, and use as our denominator the number of all correctlylabelled constituents.
    (We will henceforth refer to this as the 'with-null' measure.)
    On the other hand, we could just count constituents with the correct tag, and use as our denominators the total number of tagged, correc
