y, with a high level of ambiguity.
    On average, in our corpus, the number of possible analyses per word reached 2.4 (in contrast to 1.4 for English).
    In Hebrew, several morphemes combine into a single word in both agglutinative and fusional ways.
    This results in a potentially high number of tags for each word.
    In contrast to English tag sets whose sizes range from 48 to 195, the number of tags for Hebrew, based on all combinations of the morphological attributes (part-of-speech, gender, number, person, tense, status, and the affixes' properties2), can grow theoretically to about 300,000 tags.
    In practice, we found only 1,934 tags in a corpus of news stories we gathered, which contains about 6M words.
    The large size of such a tag set (about 10 times larger than the most comprehensive English tag set) is problematic in term of data sparseness.
    Each morphological combination appears rarely, and more samples are required in order to learn the probabilistic model.
