(Z,r1) indicates that the structure rooted at node Z is to be deleted, and rule-trace(r1,del(Z,X)) adds a trace of this rule to an accumulating history of rule applications.
    This history records the relation of transferred f-structures to the original f-structure and is available for stochastic disambiguation. slept.
    ), the optional deletion of parts of coordinate structures (e.g., They laughed and giggled. can become They giggled.
    ), and certain simplifications (e.g.
    It is clear that the earth is round. can become The earth is round. but It seems that he is asleep. cannot become He is asleep.).
    For example, one possible post-transfer output of the sentence in Fig.
    1 is shown in Fig.
    2.
    The transfer rules are independent of the grammar and are not constrained to preserve the grammaticality or wellformedness of the reduced f-structures.
    Some of the reduced structures therefore may not correspond to any English sentence, and these are eliminated from future consideration by u
