 identified this as a coreferent path!
    We address this problem with a two-stage extraction procedure.
    We first bootstrap gender/number information using the pronounpronoun paths as described in Section 4.1.
    We then use this gender/number information to count paths where an initial noun (with probabilisticallyassigned gender/number) and following pronoun are connected by the dependency path, recording the agreement or disagreement of their gender/number category.'
    These superior paths are then used to re-bootstrap our final gender/number information used in the evaluation (Section 6).
    We also bootstrap paths where the nodes in the path are replaced by their grammatical category.
    This allows us to learn general syntactic constraints not dependent on the surface forms of the words (including, but not limited to, the Binding Theory principles).
    A separate set of these noncoreferent paths is also used as a feature in our sys'As desired, this modification allows the first example to prov
