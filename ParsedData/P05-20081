    Several diverse applications exist for this potential technology, ranging from the automatic filtering of abusive messages (Spertus, 1997) to an in-depth analysis of market trends and consumer opinions (Dave et al., 2003).
    This is a complex and challenging task for a computer to achieve &#8212; consider the difficulties involved in instructing a computer to recognise sarcasm, for example.
    Previous work has shown that traditional text classification approaches can be quite effective when applied to the sentiment analysis problem.
    Models such as Naive Bayes (NB), Maximum Entropy (ME) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) can determine the sentiment of texts.
    Pang et al. (2002) used a bagof-features framework (based on unigrams and bigrams) to train these models from a corpus of movie reviews labelled as positive or negative.
    The best accuracy achieved was 82.9%, using an SVM trained on unigram features.
