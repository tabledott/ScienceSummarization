ed at St, built with rules from the grammar G. We will denote strings either as w or as wowi .
    &#8226; &#8226; wn, where wn is understood to be the last terminal symbol in the string.
    For simplicity in displaying equations, from this point forward let w/ be the substring wj.
    Let Twg be the set of all complete trees rooted at the start symbol, with the string of terminals zug as leaves.
    We call Tzq the set of complete parses of wg.
    A PCFG is a CFG with a probability assigned to each rule; specifically, each righthand side has a probability given the left-hand side of the rule.
    The probability of a parse tree is the product of the probabilities of each rule in the tree.
    Provided a PCFG is consistent (or tight), which it always will be in the approach we will be advocating, this defines a proper probability distribution over completed trees.'
    A PCFG also defines a probability distribution over strings of words (terminals) in the following way: The intuition behind Equation 1 is th
