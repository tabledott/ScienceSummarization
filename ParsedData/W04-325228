    TextRank succeeds in identifying the most important sentences in a text based on information exclusively drawn from the text itself.
    Unlike other supervised systems, which attempt to learn what makes a good summary by training on collections of summaries built for other articles, TextRank is fully unsupervised, and relies only on the given text to derive an extractive summary, which represents a summarization model closer to what humans are doing when producing an abstract for a given document.

    For instance, sentence 15 in the example provided in Figure 3 would not be identified as &#8220;important&#8221; based on the number of connections it has with other vertices in the graph, but it is identified as &#8220;important&#8221; by TextRank (and by humans &#8211; see the referen
