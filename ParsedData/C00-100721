e both knowledge-based and stochas- tic components, with the aim of comparing their behaviors, and using one type as a back-up tbr the other type.
  Finally, we will explore FI;R- OUS when applied to a language tbr which a much more limited XTAG grammar is available (for example, specit[ying only the basic sentence word order as, sw, SVO, and speci(ying subject- verb agreement).
  In the long run, we intend FEI/OUS to become a flexible system which will use hand-crafted knowledge as much as possible and stochastic models as much as necessary.
