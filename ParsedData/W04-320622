o remove syntactic variations referring to the same candidate template (typically passive/active variations).
    Three possible judgment categories have been considered: Correct if an entailment relationship in at least one direction holds between the judged template and the pivot template in some non-bizarre context; Incorrect if there is no reasonable context and variable instantiation in which entailment holds; No Evaluation if the judge cannot come to a definite conclusion.
    Each of the three assessors (referred to as J#1, J#2, and J#3) issued judgments for the 752 different templates.
    Correct templates resulted to be 283, 313, and 295 with respect to the three judges.
    No evaluation&#8217;s were 2, 0, and 16, while the remaining templates were judged Incorrect.
    For each verb, we calculate Yield as the absolute number of Correct templates found and Precision as the percentage of good templates out of all extracted templates.
    Obtained Precision is 44.15%, averaged over the 53 verbs and t
