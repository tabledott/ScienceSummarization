f very similar elements might unduly cause the merger of two clusters.
			An alternative considers the number of pairs of elements whose similarity exceeds a certain threshold (Guha, Rastogi, Kyuseok 1998).
			However, this may cause undesirable mergers when there are a large number of pairs whose similarities barely exceed the threshold.
			Chameleon clustering combines the two approaches.
			K-means clustering is often used on large data sets since its complexity is linear in n, the number of elements to be clustered.
			K-means is a family of partitional clustering algorithms that iteratively assigns each element to one of K clusters according to the centroid closest to it and recomputes the centroid of each cluster as the average of the cluster?s elements.
			K-means has complexity O(K?T?n) and is efficient for many clustering tasks.
			Because the initial centroids are randomly selected, the resulting clusters vary in quality.
			Some sets of initial centroids lead to poor convergence rates or poor clust
