omputation of consensus translations with our approach.
    In particular, we will present details of the enhanced alignment and reordering procedure.
    A large set of experimental results on several machine translation tasks is presented in Section 3, which is followed by a summary.
  
  
    The proposed approach takes advantage of multiple translations for a whole test corpus to compute a consensus translation for each sentence in this corpus.
    Given a single source sentence in the test corpus, we combine M translation hypotheses Ei, ... , EM from M MT engines.
    We first choose one of the hypotheses Em as the primary one.
    We consider this primary hypothesis to have the &#8220;correct&#8221; word order.
    We then align and reorder the other, secondary hypotheses En(n = 1, ..., M; n =&#65533; m) to match this word order.
    Since each hypothesis may have an acceptable word order, we let every hypothesis play the role of the primary translation once, and thus align all pairs of hypotheses (En,
