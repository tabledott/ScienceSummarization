 LR parser faces an indeterminacy when it enters a state in which there is more than one possible action, given the current lookahead.
    In a particular state there cannot be more than one shift or accept action, but there can be several reduce actions, each specifying a reduction with a different rule.
    When parsing, each shift or reduce choice must lead to a different final structure, and so the indeterminacy represents a point of syntactic ambiguity (although it may not correspond to a genuinely global syntactic ambiguity in the input, on account of the limited amount of lookahead).
    In the ANLT grammar and lexicon, lexical ambiguity is at least as pervasive as structural ambiguity.
    A naive implementation of an interactive LR parser would ask the user the correct category for each ambiguous word as it was shifted; many open-class words are assigned upwards of twenty lexical categories by the ANLT lexicon with comparatively fine distinctions between them, so this strategy would be completely imp
