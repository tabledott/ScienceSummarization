    These initial results provide us with a baseline for quantifying improvements resulting from distinct modifications to the algorithms.
    In contrast, the algorithms presented in section 4.3 are developed using the 10 narratives previously used for testing as a training set of narratives.
    The algorithms in this section are developed by tuning the previous algorithms (e.g., by considering both new and modified linguistic features) such that performance on the training set is increased.
    The resulting algorithms are then evaluated by examining their performance on a separate test set of 5 more narratives.
    (The remaining 5 of the 20 narratives in the corpus are reserved for future research.)
    The 10 training narratives range in length from 51 to 162 phrases (Avg.=101.4), or from 38 to 121 clauses (Avg.=76.8).
    The 5 test narratives range in length from 47 to 113 phrases (Avg.=87.4), or from 37 to 101 clauses (Avg.=69.0).
    The ratios of test to training data measured in narratives,
