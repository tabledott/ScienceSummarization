s of improved translation quality by using the consensus translation as derived from the rescored N-best lists.
    In the IWSLT 2004 evaluation, the English reference translations for the Chinese-English and Japanese-English test corpora were the same, except for a permutation of the sentences.
    Thus, we could combine MT systems which have different source and the same target language, performing multi-source machine translation (described e. g. by (Och and Ney, 2001)).
    We combined two Japanese-English and two Chinese-English systems.
    The best performing system was a JapaneseEnglish system with a BLEU score of 44.7%, see Table 5.
    By computing the consensus translation, we improved this score to 49.6%, and also significantly reduced the error rates.
    To investigate the potential of the proposed approach, we generated the N-best lists (N = 1000) of consensus translations.
    Then, for each sentence, we selected the hypothesis in the N-best list with the lowest word error rate with respect to
