onfusion-network-based system combination algorithms have been developed to combine outputs of multiple machine translation (MT) systems to form a consensus output (Bangalore, et al. 2001, Matusov et al., 2006, Rosti et al., 2007, Sim et al., 2007).
    A confusion network comprises a sequence of sets of alternative words, possibly including null&#8217;s, with associated scores.
    The consensus output is then derived by selecting one word from each set of alternatives, to produce the sequence with the best overall score, which could be assigned in various ways such as by voting, by using posterior probability estimates, or by using a combination of these measures and other features.
    Constructing a confusion network requires choosing one of the hypotheses as the backbone (also called &#8220;skeleton&#8221; in the literature), and other hypotheses are aligned to it at the word level.
    High quality hypothesis alignment is crucial to the performance of the resulting system combination.
    However, there
