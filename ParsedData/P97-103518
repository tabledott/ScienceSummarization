fwPrevious work has shown that this can be done with high reliability (Hirschman and Pao, 1993). ferent cost measures in order to determine their relative contribution to performance.
    The next section explains how to combine is with a set of ci to yield an overall performance measure.
    Given the definition of success and costs above and the model in Figure 1, performance for any (sub)dialogue D is defined as follows:&amp;quot; Here a is a weight on is, the cost functions ci are weighted by wi, and H is a Z score normalization function (Cohen, 1995).
    The normalization function is used to overcome the problem that the values of ci are not on the same scale as K, and that the cost measures ci may also be calculated over widely varying scales (e.g. response delay could be measured using seconds while, in the example, costs were calculated in terms of number of utterances).
    This problem is easily solved by normalizing each factor x to its Z score: cr, where is the standard deviation for x.
