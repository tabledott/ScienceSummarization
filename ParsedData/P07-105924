t expansion.
  
  
    We presented two techniques for query expansion in answer retrieval that are based on SMT technology.
    Our method for question-answer translation uses a large corpus of question-answer pairs extracted from FAQ pages to learn a translation model from questions to answers.
    SMT-based paraphrasing utilizes large amounts of bilingual data as a new information source to extract phrase-level synonyms.
    Both SMT-based techniques take the entire query context into account when adding new terms to the original query.
    In an experimental comparison with a baseline tfidf approach and a local query expansion technique on the task of answer retrieval from FAQ pages, we showed a significant improvement of both SMT-based query expansion over both baselines.
    Despite the small-scale nature of our current experimental results, we hope to apply the presented techniques to general web retrieval in future work.
    Another task for future work is to scale up the extraction of question-answer
