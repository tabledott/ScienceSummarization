 of as from means simply it is efficiently accessible through the index active ...) be thought of as incident from, or through, the index key property of this scheme is that active and inactive edges interact by virtue of indices that they share and, by letting vertices correspond to indices, we collect together sets of edges that could interact.
    We illustrate the modified procedure with the sentence (10) whose semantics we will take to be (11), the grammar rules (12)-(14), and the lexical entries in (15).
    (10) The dog saw the cat.
    (11) dog(d), def(d), saw(s), past(s), cat(c), def(c), argl(s. d), arg2(s, c).

    Arguments have been made in favor of a head-driven strategy which would, however, have been marginally more (e.g. in Kay (1989), Shieber
