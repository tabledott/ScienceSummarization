 alone are usefully distinguished from those which occur with other nomimaterial.
    This marks the with a single bit about their immediate external context: whether there are sisters.
    Given the success of parent annotation for nonterminals, it makes sense to parent antags, as well In fact, as figure 3 shows, exhaustively marking all preterminals with their parent category was the most effective single annotation we tried.
    Why should this be useful?
    Most tags have a canonical category.
    For example, occur under (only 234 of 70855 do not, mostly mistakes).
    However, when a tag that when we show such trees, we generally only show one annotation on top of the baseline at a time.
    Moreover, we do not explicitly show the binarization implicit by the horizontal markovization. two are not equivalent even given infinite data.
