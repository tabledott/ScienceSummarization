    Attempts were made to automatically extract knowledge from these sources (Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2) and, more recently, to construct large-scale knowledge bases by hand (Section 2.3.3).
    A corresponding shift away from methods based in linguistic theories and towards empirical methods also occurred at this time, as well as a decrease in emphasis on do-all systems in favor of &amp;quot;intermediate&amp;quot; tasks such as WSD.

    This work contributed significantly to lexical semantic studies, but it appears that the initial goal&#8212;the automatic extraction of large knowledge bases&#8212;was not fully achieved: the only currently widely available large-scale lexical knowledge base (WordNet, see below) was created by hand.
    We have elsewhere demonstrated the difficulties of automatically extracting relations as simple as hyperon
