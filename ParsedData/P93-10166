parsed if an item is found at IF or CP node whose surface string is the input sentence.
    A parse tree of the sentence can be retrieved by tracing the sources of the item.
    The message passing process for analyzing the sentence 2V:NP denotes verbs taking an NP complement.
    Similarly, V:IP denotes verbs taking a CP complement, N:CP represents nouns taking a CP complement. is illustrated in Figure 2.a.
    In order not to convolute the figure, we have only shown the items that are involved in the parse tree of the sentence and their propagation paths.
    The parsing process is described as follows: which means that normal NPs need to be casemarked.
    Therefore, i4 acquires -cm.
    Item i4 is then sent to nodes that have links to NP.
    4.
    The word &amp;quot;was&amp;quot; is represented by item i5, which is sent to Ibar via I.
    5.
    The word &amp;quot;eaten&amp;quot; can be either the past participle or the passive voice of &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot;.
    The second possibility is represented
