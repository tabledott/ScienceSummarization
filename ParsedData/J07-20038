7), that have no dependence on syntactic theory beyond the idea that natural language is hierarchical.
    If these methods distinguish between different categories, they typically do not distinguish very many.
    Our approach, as presented here, falls squarely into this family.
    By contrast, other approaches, exemplified by that of Yamada and Knight (2001), do make use of parallel data with syntactic annotations, either in the form of phrase-structure trees or dependency trees (Ding and Palmer 2005; Quirk, Menezes, and Cherry 2005).
    Because syntactically annotated corpora are comparatively small, obtaining parsed parallel text in quantity usually entails running an automatic parser on a parallel corpus to produce noisy annotations.
    Both of these strands of research have recently begun to explore extraction of larger rules, guided by word alignments.
    The extraction method we use, which is a straightforward generalization of phrase extraction from word-aligned parallel text, has been independen
