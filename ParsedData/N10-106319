 is a commonly exploited trick elsewhere in machine translation.
    It is mostly effective here as well, improving all cases except for the Bulgarian-English CRF where the regression is slight.
    More successful are the Wikipedia features, which provide an auxiliary signal of potential parallelism.
    The gains from adding the lexicon-based features can be dramatic as in the case of Bulgarian (the CRF model average precision increased by nearly 9 points).
    The lower gains on Spanish and German may be due in part to the lack of language-specific training data.
    These results are very promising and motivate further exploration.
    We also note that this is perhaps the first successful practical application of an automatically induced word translation lexicon.
    We also present results in the context of a full machine translation system to evaluate the potential utility of this data.
    A standard phrasal SMT system (Koehn et al., 2003) serves as our testbed, using a conventional set of models: phr
