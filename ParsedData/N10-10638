tionary).
    We propose an alternative approach: we learn a ranking model, which, for each sentence in the source document, selects either a sentence in the target document that it is parallel to, or &#8220;null&#8221;.
    This formulation of the problem avoids the class imbalance issue of the binary classifier.
    In both the binary classifier approach and the ranking approach, we use a Maximum Entropy classifier, following Munteanu and Marcu (2005).
    In Wikipedia article pairs, it is common for parallel sentences to occur in clusters.
    A global sentence alignment model is able to capture this phenomenon.
    For both parallel and comparable corpora, global sentence alignments have been used, though the alignments were monotonic (Gale and Church, 1991; Moore, 2002; Zhao and Vogel, 2002).
    Our model is a first order linear chain Conditional Random Field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001).
    The set of source and target sentences are observed.
    For each source sentence, we have a hidden variable in
