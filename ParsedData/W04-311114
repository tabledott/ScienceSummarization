ic structure (Propbanking).
    In this project, the syntactic and semantic annotation is being done on a corpus which is also being annotated for entities, as described in Section 2.
    Since semantic taggers of the sort described above result in semantic roles assigned to syntactic tree constituents, it is desirable to have the entities correspond to syntactic constituents so that the semantic roles are assigned to entities.
    The entity information can function as type information and be taken advantage of by learning algorithms to help characterize the properties of the terms filling specified roles in a given predicate.
    This integration of these three different annotation levels, including the entities, is being done for the first time2, and we discuss here three main challenges to this correspondence between entities and constituents: (1) entities that are large enough to cut across multiple constituents, (2) entities within prenominal modifiers, and (3) coordination.3 Relations and Large Entitie
