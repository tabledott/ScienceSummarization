two ways: PCS measures the proportion of correctly classified tokens in the scope sequence, whereas PCS-2 measures the proportion of nouns and verbs that are correctly classifed in the scope sequence.
    This less strict way of computing correctness is motivated by the fact that being able to determine the concepts and relations that are speculated (indicated by content words) is the most important use of the hedge scope finder.
    Results show that the system achieves a high percentage of fully correct scopes, and that, although performance is lower for the papers and clinical corpora, the system is portable.
    Table 7 shows the results of the negation scope finding system also with gold standard negation cues.
    The comparison of results shows that for abstracts and papers the scores are higher for the hedge system, which means that the system can be used for finding both types of scope.
    The results of the hedge system with predicted hedge cues are presented in Table 8.
    The hedge cues have bee
