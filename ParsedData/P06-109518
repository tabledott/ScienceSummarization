gmentation of the rule-set, by a factor of 22.
    GTag with this augmented rule-set might be a useful baseline to consider, since one would expect the gigantic size of the Google &#8216;corpus&#8217; to yield fairly robust, broad-coverage rules.
    What if both a core GTag rule and a VerbOcean-derived rule could both apply?
    We assume the one with the higher confidence is chosen.
    However, we don&#8217;t have enough data to reliably estimate rule confidences for the original GTag rules; so, for the purposes of VerbOcean rule integration, we assigned either the original VerbOcean rules as having greater confidence than the original GTag rules in case of a conflict (i.e., a preference for the more specific rule), or viceversa.
    The results are shown in Table 4 (lines GTag+VerbOcean).
    The combined rule set, under both voting schemes, had no statistically significant difference in accuracy from the original GTag rule set.
    So, ME-C beat this baseline as well.
    The reason VerbOcean didn&#8217;
