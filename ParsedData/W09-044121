variant of TERp that did not use the paraphrase probability at all but instead only used the actual edit distance between the two phrases to determine the final cost of a phrase substitution.
    The results for this experiment are shown in the second row of Table 5.
    We can see that this variant works as well as the full version of TERp that utilizes paraphrase probabilities.
    This confirms our intuition that the probability computed via the pivot-method is not a very useful predictor of semantic equivalence for use in TERp.
    To determine the effect that the pivot language might have on the quality and utility of the extracted paraphrases in TERp, we used paraphrase pairsmade available by Callison-Burch (2008).
    These paraphrase pairs were extracted from Europarl data using each of 10 European languages (German, Italian, French etc.) as a pivot language separately and then combining the extracted paraphrase pairs.
    Callison-Burch (2008) also extracted and made available syntactically constrain
