    Since the number of partitions for a given set of nouns is extremely large, the problem of selecting the best model from among all possible class-based models is most likely intractable.
    In this paper, we reduce the number of possible partitions to consider by using a thesaurus as prior knowledge, following a basic idea of Resnik's (1992).
    In particular, we restrict our attention to those partitions that exist within the thesaurus in the form of a cut.
    By thesaurus, we mean a tree in which each leaf node stands for a noun, while each internal node represents a noun class, and domination stands for set inclusion (see Figure 3).
    A cut in a tree is any set of nodes in the tree that defines a partition of the leaf nodes, viewing each node as representing the set of all leaf nodes it dominates.
    For example, in the thesaurus of Figure 3, there are five cuts: [ANIMAL], [BIRD, INSECT], [BIRD, bug, bee, insect], [swallow, crow, eagle, bird, INSECT], and [swallow, crow, eagl
