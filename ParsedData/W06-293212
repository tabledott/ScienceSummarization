ach to their head words with much lower accuracy: 69% for main verbs, 75% for the verb ser, and 65% for coordinating conjunctions.
    These words form 17% of the test corpus.
    Other high-frequency word classes with relatively low attachment accuracy are prepositions (80%), adverbs (82%) and subordinating conjunctions (80%), for a total of another 23% of the test corpus.
    These weaknesses are not surprising, since these decisions encode the more global aspects of sentence structure: arrangement of clauses and adverbial dependents in multi-clause sentences, and prepositional phrase attachment.
    In a preliminary test of this hypothesis, we looked at all of the sentences from a development set in which a main verb is incorrectly attached.
    We confirmed that the main clause is often misidentified in multi-clause sentences, or that one of several conjoined clauses is incorrectly taken as the main clause.
    To test this further, we added features to count the number of commas and conjunctions between
