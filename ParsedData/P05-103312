 performance on our development set: which simplifies the decoder implementation.
    Moreover, we prohibit nonterminals that are adjacent on the French side, a major cause of spurious ambiguity.
    5.
    A rule must have at least one pair of aligned words, making translation decisions always based on some lexical evidence.
    Now we must hypothesize weights for all the derivations.
    Och&#8217;s method gives equal weight to all the extracted phrase occurences.
    However, our method may extract many rules from a single initial phrase pair; therefore we distribute weight equally among initial phrase pairs, but distribute that weight equally among the rules extracted from each.
    Treating this distribution as our observed data, we use relativefrequency estimation to obtain P(y  |&#945;) and P(&#945;  |y).
  
  
    Our decoder is a CKY parser with beam search together with a postprocessor for mapping French derivations to English derivations.
    Given a French sentence f, it finds the best derivation
