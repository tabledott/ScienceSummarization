  ISP: Learning Inferential Selectional Preferences
  
    Semantic inference is a key component for advanced natural language understanding.
    However, existing collections of automatically acquired inference rules have shown disappointing results when used in applications such as textual entailment and question answering.
    This papresents a collection of methods for automatically learning admissible argument values to which an inference rule be applied, which we call and methods for filtering out incorrect inferences.
    We present empirical evidence of its effectiveness.
  
  
    Semantic inference is a key component for advanced natural language understanding.
    Several important applications are already relying heavily on inference, including question answering (Moldovan et al. 2003; Harabagiu and Hickl 2006), information extraction (Romano et al.
    2006), and textual entailment (Szpektor et al. 2004).
    In response, several researchers have created resources for enabling semantic inference
