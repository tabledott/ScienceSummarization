    Handling the JS class alone requires recognizing coreferent NPs in appositive and genitive constructions as well as those that occur as proper names, possessive pronouns, and definite NPs.
  
  
    Our approach to the coreference task stems from the observation that each group of coreferent noun phrases defines an equivalence classl.
    Therefore, it is natural to view the problem as one of partitioning, or clustering, the noun phrases.
    Intuitively, all of the noun phrases used to describe a specific concept will be &amp;quot;near&amp;quot; or related in some way, i.e. their conceptual &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; will be small.
    Given a description of each noun phrase and a method for measuring the distance between two noun phrases, a clustering algorithm can then group noun phrases together: Noun phrases with distance greater than a clustering radius r are not placed into the same partition and so are not considered coreferent.
    The subsections below describe the noun phrase represent
