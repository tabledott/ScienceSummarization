rphological filter for Hobbs' procedural filter.
    Let the Mods (modifiers) of a head H be the sisters of H in the Slot Grammar representation of the phrase that H heads.
    Our specification of Hobbs' algorithm for Slot Grammar is as follows: We ran this version of Hobbs' algorithm on the test set that we used for the blind test of RAP and RAPSTAT; the results appear in Table 5.
    It is important to note that the test set does not include pleonastic pronouns or lexical anaphors (reflexive or reciprocal pronouns), neither of which are dealt with by Hobbs' algorithm.
    Moreover, our Slot Grammar implementation of the algorithm gives it the full advantage of RAP's syntactic&#8212;morphological filter, which is more powerful than the configurational filter built into the original specification of the algorithm.
    Therefore, the test results provide a direct comparison of RAP's salience metric and Hobbs' search procedure.
    Hobbs' algorithm was more successful than RAP in resolving intersentential anap
