election techniques which compare large numbers of alternative model specifications.
    This suggests that more comprehensive experiments to compare the convergence rate and accuracy of various algorithms on a wider range of problems is called for.
    In addition, there is a larger lesson to be drawn from these results.
    We typically think of computational linguistics as being primarily a symbolic discipline.
    However, statistical natural language processing involves non-trivial numeric computations.
    As these results show, natural language processing can take great advantage of the algorithms and software libraries developed by and for more quantitatively oriented engineering and computational sciences.
