s of elementary trees rather than single trees.
    A multicomponent Tree Adjoining Grammar (MCTAG) consists of a finite set of finite elementary tree sets.
    We must adjoin all trees in an auxiliary tree set together as a single step in the derivation.
    The adjunction operation with respect to tree sets (multicomponent adjunction) is defined as follows.
    Each member of a set of trees can be adjoined into distinct nodes of trees in a single elementary tree set, i.e, derivations always involve the adjunction of a derived auxiliary tree set into an elementary tree set.
    Lilo CFG's, TAG's, and HG's the derivation tree set of a MCTAG will be a local set.
    The derivation trees of a MCTAG are similar to those of a TAG.
    Instead of the names of elementary trees of a TAG, the nodes are labeled by a sequence of names of trees in an elementary tree set.
    Since trees in a tree set are adjoined together, the addressing scheme uses a sequence of pairings of the address and name of the elementary tree a
