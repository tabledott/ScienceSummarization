ously optimize the total similarity within each segment and dissimilarity across various segments.
    We showed that global analysis of lexical distribution improves the segmentation accuracy and is robust in the presence of recognition errors.
    Combining global analysis with advanced methods for smoothing (Ji and Zha, 2003) and weighting could further boost the segmentation performance.
    Our current implementation does not automatically determine the granularity of a resulting segmentation.
    This issue has been explored in the past (Ji and Zha, 2003; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001), and we will explore the existing strategies in our framework.
    We believe that the algorithm has to produce segmentations for various levels of granularity, depending on the needs of the application that employs it.
    Our ultimate goal is to automatically generate tables of content for lectures.
    We plan to investigate strategies for generating titles that will succinctly describe the content of each segment.
    We
