ed words to stay together, and reduces the number of parameters used to describe word-order variation.
    But more importantly, it makes structural assumptions that eliminate large portions of the space of alignments, based on linguistic motivatations.
    This greatly reduces the search space and makes possible a polynomial-time optimization algorithm.
  
  
    The new translation model is based on the recently introduced bilingual language modeling approach.
    Specifically, the model employs a bracketing transduction grammar or BTG (Wu, 1995a), which is a special case of inversion transduction grammars or ITGs (Wu, 1995c; Wu, 1995c; Wu, 1995b; Wu, 1995d).
    These formalisms were originally developed for the purpose of parallel corpus annotation, with applications for bracketing, alignment, and segmentation.
    This paper finds they are also useful for the translation system itself.
    In this section we summarize the main properties of BTGs and ITGs.
    An ITG consists of context-free productions w
