			When we apply phrase substitution on anon-terminal node, then any simplification operation (including dropping, reordering and substitu tion) cannot happen on its descendants any more 1356 because when a node has been replaced then its descendants are no longer existing.
			Therefore, for each non-terminal node we must decide whether a substitution should take place at this node or at itsdescendants.
			We perform substitution for a non terminal node if the following constraint is met: Max(SubFT (?|node)) ? Y ch:node Max(SubFT (?|ch)).
			where ch is a child of the node.
			canbe any substitution in the SubFT.
			The proba bility of the phrase substitution is calculated as P (sub|node) = SubFT (Substitution|Origin).Fig.
			5 shows one of the possible substitution re sults for our example where ?ancient?
			is replaced by ?old?.
