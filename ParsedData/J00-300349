eters, and the best values were then tested on the respective other half.
    The reported results are from the aggregate outcome on the two test set halves. on recognized words with the Top-5 tree classifier mentioned in Section 5.2.3.
    Results are summarized in Table 9.
    As shown, the combined classifier presents a slight improvement over the recognizer-based classifier.
    The experiment without discourse grammar indicates that the combined evidence is considerably stronger than either knowledge source alone, yet this improvement seems to be made largely redundant by the use of priors and the discourse grammar.
    For example, by definition DECLARATIVE-QUESTIONS are not marked by syntax (e.g., by subject-auxiliary inversion) and are thus confusable with STATEMENTS and OPINIONS.
    While prosody is expected to help disambiguate these cases, the ambiguity can also be removed by examining the context of the utterance, e.g., by noticing that the following utterance is a YES-ANSWER or NO-ANSWER.
