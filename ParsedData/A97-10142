hall be recoverable from the annotation, cf.
    (Marcus et al., 1994).
    Multi-stratal representation: Clear separation of different description levels is desirable.
    Data-drivenness: The scheme must provide representational means for all phenomena occurring in texts.
    Disambiguation is based on human processing skills (cf.
    (Marcus et. al., 1994), (Sampson, 1995), (Black et. al.
    , 1996)).
    The typical treebank architecture is as follows: Structures: A context-free backbone is augmented with trace-filler representations of non-local dependencies.
    The underlying argument SirlteilITC is not represented directly, but can be recovered from the tree and trace-filler annotations.
    Syntactic category is encoded in node labels.
    Grammatical functions constitute a complex label system (cf.
    (Bies et al., 1995), (Sampson, 1995)).
    Part-of-Speech is annotated at word level.
    Thus the context-free constituent backbone plays a pivotal role in the annotation scheme.
