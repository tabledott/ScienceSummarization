    An example of a sentence and its dependency tree with associated features is shown in Figure 3.

    3.1.2 Alignment.
    Our alignment of dependency trees is driven by two sources of information: the similarity between the structure of the dependency trees and the similarity between lexical items.
    In determining the structural similarity between two trees, we take into account the types of edges (which indicate the relationships between nodes).
    An edge is labeled by the syntactic function of the two nodes it connects (e.g., subject&#8211; verb).
    It is unlikely that an edge connecting a subject and verb in one sentence, for example, corresponds to an edge connecting a verb and an adjective in another sentence.
    The word similarity measures take into account more than word identity: They also identify pairs of paraphrases, using WordNet and a paraphrasing dictionary.
    We automatically construct
