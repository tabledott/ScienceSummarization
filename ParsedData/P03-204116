    We are now prepared to discuss the synchronous case.
    A synchronous TSG consists of a set of elementary tree pairs.
    An elementary tree pair t is a tuple (t1, t2, q, m, s).
    Here t1 and t2 are elementary trees without state labels: we write tj = (Vj,Vji,Ej,`j). q E Q is the root state as before. m C_ V1f x V2f is a matching between t1&#8217;s and t2&#8217;s frontier nodes,6.
    Let m&#175; denote m U {(d1, null) : d1 is unmatched in m} U {(null, d2) : d2 is unmatched in m}.
    Finally, s : m&#175; &#8594; Q assigns a state to each frontier node pair or unpaired frontier node.
    In the figure of section 2, donnent un baiser a` has 2 frontier nodes and kiss has 3, yielding 13 possible matchings.
    Note that least one English node must remain unmatched; it still generates a full subtree, aligned with null.
    As before, a derived tree pair T has the same f
