s can use longer phrases and that phrases can include unchanged words from the context, e.g., the gold edit from the example in Section 1 is (4, 5, word, {a word, words}).
    However, it seems unrealistic to allow an arbitrary number of unchanged words in an edit.
    In particular, we want to avoid very large edits that cover complete sentences.
    Therefore, we limit the number of unchanged words by a parameter u.
    To allow for phrase-level edits, we add transitive edges to the lattice as long as the number of unchanged words in the newly added edit is not greater than u and the edit changes at least one word.
    Let e1 = (a1, b1, C1) and e2 = (a2, b2, C2) be two edits corresponding to adjacent edges in the lattice, with the first end offset b1 being equal to the second start offset a2.
    We can combine them into a new edit e3 = (a1, b2, C1 + C2), where C1 + C2 is the concatenation of strings C1 and C2.
    The cost of a transitive edge is the sum of the costs of its parts.
