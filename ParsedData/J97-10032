ce of life on earth and other planets.
    Its contents can be described as consisting of the following subtopic discussions (numbers indicate paragraphs): Subtopic structure is sometimes marked in technical texts by headings and subheadings.
    Brown and Yule (1983, 140) state that this kind of division is one of the most basic in discourse.
    However, many expository texts consist of long sequences of paragraphs with very little structural demarcation, and for these a subtopical segmentation can be useful.
    This article describes fully implemented techniques for the automatic detection of multi-paragraph subtopical structure.
    Because the goal is to partition texts into contiguous, nonoverlapping subtopic segments, I call the general approach TextTiling (Hearst, 1993, 1994a, 1994b).1 Subtopic discussions are assumed to occur within the scope of one or more overarching main topics, which span the length of the text.
    This two-level structure is chosen for reasons of computational feasibility and
