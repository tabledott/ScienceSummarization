mple gives evidence that the children is the ARG2 (beneficiary), not the ARG1 in this case.
    Let us think of a graphical model over a set of m variables, one for each node in the parse tree t, representing the labels of the nodes and the dependencies between them.
    In order for a model over these variables to capture, for example, the statistical tendency of some semantic roles to occur at most once (e.g., that there is usually at most one constituent labeled AGENT), there must be a dependency link between any two variables.
    To estimate the probability that a certain node gets the role AGENT, we need to know if any of the other nodes were labeled with this role.
    We propose such a model, with a very rich graphical model structure, which is globally conditioned on the observation (the parse tree).2 Such a model is formally a Conditional Random Field (CRF) (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001).
    However, note that in practice this term has previously been used almost exclusively to describe the
