).
    Our study of these topics is still far from complete; therefore, besides offering some initial results, we shall discuss various outstanding questions.
    The connection between parsing and deduction is based on the axiomatization of context-free grammars in definite clauses, a particularly simple subset of firstorder logic (Kowalski, 1980; van Emden and Kowalski, 1976).
    This axiomatization allows us to identify contextfree parsing algorithms with proof procedures for a restricted class of definite clauses, those derived from context-free rules.
    This identification can then be generalized to include larger classes of definite clauses to which the same algorithms can be applied, with simple modifications.
    Those larger classes of definite clauses can be seen as grammar formalisms in which the atomic grammar symbols of context-free grammars have been replaced by complex symbols that are matched by unification (Robinson, 1965; Colmerauer, 1978; Pereira and Warren, 1980).
    The simplest of th
