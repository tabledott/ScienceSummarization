			Research and development for information extraction from biomedical literature (bio textmining) has been rapidly advancing due to demands caused by information overload in the genome-related field.
			Natural language process ing (NLP) techniques have been regarded as useful for this purpose.
			Now that focus of in formation extraction is shifting from extraction of ?nominal?
			information such as named entity to ?verbal?
			information such as relations of enti ties including events and functions, syntactic analysis is an important issue of NLP application in biomedical domain.
			In extraction of rela tion, the roles of entities participating in the relation must be identified along with the verb that represents the relation itself.
			In text analysis, this corresponds to identifying the subjects, ob jects, and other arguments of the verb.
			Though rule-based relation information ex traction systems using surface pattern matching and/or shallow parsing can achieve high precisio
