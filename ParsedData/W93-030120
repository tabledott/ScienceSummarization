(0.06) To (0.05) We approximate the offset probabilities, o(k), relative to A', using the maximum likelihood estimates which were computed relative to I (as described in Section 2.1.2).
    We use a dynamic programming algorithm to find the most probable alignment.
    This enables us to know the value A/ 1 when dealing with position j.
    To avoid connections with very low probability (due to a large offset) we require that i( f, lei ) &#8226; o(i &#8212; (j)) exceeds a pre-specified threshold T3.
    If the threshold is not exceeded, the connection is dropped from the alignment, and i(file) &#8226; o(i &#8212; (j)) for that connection is set to T when computing (14).
    T can therefore be interpreted as a global setting of the probability that a random position will be connected to the null 'In fact, the threshold on t(hle,), which is used to determine the relevant connections (described in the previous subsection), is used just as an efficient early application of the threshold T. This early application
