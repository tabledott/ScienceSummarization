selected semantic vectors.
    This provides a mean (&#181;) and variance (&#65533; ) of correlation We had previously illustrated NCS values on various PPMVs and showed that this type of score seems to be appropriately identifying semantic relationships.
    (For example, the PPMVs of car/cars and ally/allies had NCS values of 5.6 and 6.5 respectively, whereas car/cares and ally/all had scored only -0.14 and -1.3.)
    Further, we showed that by performing this normalizing process, one can estimate the probability that an NCS is random or not.
    We expect that random NCSs will be approximately normally distributed according to N(0,1).
    We can also estimate the distribution N(&#181;T,&#65533;T ) of true correlations and number of terms in that distribution (nT).
    If we define a function PPMVs with Prsem&gt;_T5, where T5 is an acceptance threshold.
    We showed in our earlier work that T5=85% affords high overall precision while still identifying most valid morphological relationships.
