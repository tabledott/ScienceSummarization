n language 2, length(E) &#8776; C&#183;length(F), where C is a constant tuned for the language pair.
    The use of a document length filter is described in Smith (2001), in which such a filter is shown, at the sentence level, to reduce the size of the search space exponentially in the confidence p in a (1 &#8722; p) confidence interval for a linear regression model with only linear loss of good pairs. relies on analysis of the pages&#8217; underlying HTML to determine a set of pair-specific structural values, and then uses those values to decide whether the pages are translations of one another.
    The first step in this process is to linearize the HTML structure and ignore the actual linguistic content of the documents.
    We do not attempt to exploit nonlinear structure (e.g., embedded chunks), for two reasons.
    First, we suspect that many HTML authors use tags for formatting text rather than for indicating document structure; therefore any &#8220;tree&#8221; structure is likely to be inconsistent or
