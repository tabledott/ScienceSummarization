: These values vary depending on the threshold of cosine similarity.
    As the threshold is decreased, the clusters gradually merge, finally forming one big cluster.
    We show the results of complete linkage clustering for the PERSON-GPE (PER-GPE) domain in Figure 2 and for the COMPANY-COMPANY (COM-COM) domain in Figure 3.
    With these metrics, precision fell as the threshold of cosine similarity was lowered.
    Recall increased until the threshold was almost 0, at which point it fell because the total number of correct pairs in the remaining few big clusters decreased.
    The best F-measure was 82 in the PER-GPE domain, 77 in the COM-COM domain.
    In both domains, the best F-measure was found near 0 cosine similarity.
    Generally, it is difficult to determine the threshold of similarity in advance.
    Since the best threshold of cosine similarity was almost same in the two domains, we fixed the cosine threshold at a single value just above zero for both domains for simplicity.
    We also investi
