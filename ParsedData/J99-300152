    5.2.2 Method (Distribution of Transition Types).
    Given these sample texts, we compared three approaches to the ranking of the Cf: a model whose ordering principles are based on grammatical role indicators only (see Table 1); an &amp;quot;intermediate&amp;quot; model, which can be considered a &amp;quot;naive&amp;quot; approach to free-word-order languages; and the functional model based on the information structure constraints stated in Table 11.
    For reasons discussed below, slightly modified versions of the naive and the grammatical approaches will also be considered.
    They are characterized by the additional constraint that antecedents of functional anaphors are ranked higher than the functional anaphors themselves.
    As in Section 5.1, the evaluation was carried out manually by the authors.
    Since most of the anaphors in these texts are nominal anaphors, the resolution of which is much more restricted th
