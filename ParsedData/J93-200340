    The reestimation formulae for Model 3 are Equations (34) and (39) are identical to Equations (12) and (14) and are repeated here only for convenience.
    Equations (35) and (40) are similar to Equations (23) and (25), but a(iIj, m, 1) differs from d(jii, m, 1) in that the former sums to unity over all i for fixed j while the latter sums to unity over all j for fixed i. Equations (36), (37), (38), (41), and (42), for the fertility parameters, are new.
    The trick that allows us to evaluate the right-hand sides of Equations (12) and (23) efficiently for Model 2 does not work for Model 3.
    Because of the fertility parameters, we cannot exchange the sums over al through am with the product over j in Equation (32) as we were able to for Equations (6) and (21).
    We are not, however, entirely bereft of hope.
    The alignment is a useful device precisely because some alignments are much more probable than others.
    Our strategy is to carry out the sums in Equations (32) and (34)-(38) o
