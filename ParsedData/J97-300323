tion.
    It has two parameters: a, the level of confidence and df, the number of degrees of freedom, which is one less than the sample size (df = n -1). td(c_a)/2 can be looked up in the tables for the t-distribution listed in every textbook on statistics.
    We adopted 90% confidence for which tdc-c_0.90)/2=todf.05 takes values depending on the sample size as in Figure 1.
    Using IrL instead of /5 for rule scoring favors higher estimates (15) obtained over larger samples (n).
    Even if one rule has a high estimate value but that estimate was obtained over a small sample, another rule with a lower estimate value but obtained over a large sample might be valued higher by rL.
    This rule-scoring function resembles the one used by Tzoukermann, Radev, and Gale (1995) for scoring Pos-disambiguation rules for the French tagger.
    The main difference between the two functions is that there the t value was implicitly assumed to be 1, which corresponds to a confidence level of 68% on a very large sample.
