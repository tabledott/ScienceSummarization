&#8217; semantic classes, the type of genitives, discourse and pragmatic information.
    Adjective Phrases are prepositional phrases attached to nouns acting as adjectives (cf.
    (Semmelmeyer and Bolander 1992)).
    Prepositions play an important role both syntactically and semantically.
    Semantically speaking, prepositional constructions can encode various semantic relations, their interpretations being provided most of the time by the underlying context.
    For instance, the preposition &#8220;with&#8221; can encode different semantic relations: (1) It was the girl with blue eyes (MERONYMY), The conclusion for us is that in addition to the nouns semantic classes, the preposition and the context play important roles here.
    In order to focus our research, we will concentrate for now only on noun - noun or adjective - noun compositional constructions at NP level, ie those whose meaning can be derived from the meaning of the constituent nouns (&#8220;door knob&#8221;, &#8220;cup of wine&#8221;).
