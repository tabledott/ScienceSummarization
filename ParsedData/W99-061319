ting to satisfy the above constraints as much as possible.
    The algorithm, called CoBoost, has the advantage of being more general than the decision-list learning alInput: (xi , yi), , (xim, ) ; x, E 2x, yi = +1 Initialize Di (i) = 1/m.

    This section describes an algorithm based on boosting algorithms, which were previously developed for supervised machine learning problems.
    We first give a brief overview of boosting algorithms.
    We then discuss how we adapt and generalize a boosting algorithm, AdaBoost, to the problem of named entity classification.
    The new algorithm, which we call CoBoost, uses labeled and unlabeled data and builds two classifiers in parallel.
    (We would like to note though that unlike previous boosting algorithms, the CoBoost algorithm presented here is not a boosting algorithm under Valiant's (Valiant 84) Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model.)
    This section describes AdaBoost, which is the basis for the CoBoost algorithm.
