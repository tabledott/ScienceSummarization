    Supervised part-of-speech (POS) taggers, for example, approach the level of inter-annotator agreement (Shen et al., 2007, 97.3% accuracy for English).
    However, supervised methods rely on labeled training data, which is time-consuming and expensive to generate.
    Unsupervised learning approaches appear to be a natural solution to this problem, as they require only unannotated text for training models.
    Unfortunately, the best completely unsupervised English POS tagger (that does not make use of a tagging dictionary) reaches only 76.1% accuracy (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010), making its practical usability questionable at best.
    To bridge this gap, we consider a practically motivated scenario, in which we want to leverage existing resources from a resource-rich language (like English) when building tools for resource-poor foreign languages.1 We assume that absolutely no labeled training data is available for the foreign language of interest, but that we have access to parallel data wi
