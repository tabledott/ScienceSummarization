mes the decoder uses questionable rules, for example: This rule is learned from 62 cases in our training data, where the VBN is almost always the word given.
    However, the decoder misuses this rule with other VBNs.
    So we can add a feature that penalizes any rule in which a PP dominates a VBN and NP-C.
    The feature class bad-rewrite comprises penalties for the following configurations based on our analysis of the tuning set: Node count features It is possible that the decoder creates English trees with too many or too few nodes of a particular syntactic category.
    For example, there may be an tendency to generate too many determiners or past-tense verbs.
    We therefore add a count feature for each of the 109 (non-split) English nonterminal symbols.
    For a rule like the feature node-count-NPB gets value 1, nodecount-NNP gets value 2, and all others get 0.
    Insertion features Among the rules we extract from bilingual corpora are target-language insertion rules, which have a word on the Engli
