e parents for each word in the sentence (we set k = 10); this reduces the number of candidate arcs to |A |= kn.11 This strategy is similar to the one employed by Carreras et al. (2008) to prune the search space of the actual parser.
    The ranker is a local model trained using a max-margin criterion; it is arc-factored and not subject to any structural constraints, so it is very fast.
    The actual parser was trained via the online structured passive-aggressive algorithm of Crammer et al. (2006); it differs from the 1-best MIRA algorithm of McDonald et al.
    (2005) by solving a sequence of loss-augmented inference problems.12 The number of iterations was set to 10.
    The results are summarized in Table 1; for the sake of comparison, we reproduced three strong 8We used the provided train/test splits except for English, for which we tested on the development partition.
    For training, sentences longer than 80 words were discarded.
    For testing, all sentences were kept (the longest one has length 118)
