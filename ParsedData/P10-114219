aken from McCallum and Wellner (2003), where a document consists of three NPs: &#8220;Mr.
    Clinton,&#8221; &#8220;Clinton,&#8221; and &#8220;she.&#8221; The mentionpair model may determine that &#8220;Mr.
    Clinton&#8221; and &#8220;Clinton&#8221; are coreferent using string-matching features, and that &#8220;Clinton&#8221; and &#8220;she&#8221; are coreferent based on proximity and lack of evidence for gender and number disagreement.
    However, these two pairwise decisions together with transitivity imply that &#8220;Mr.
    Clinton&#8221; and &#8220;she&#8221; will end up in the same cluster, which is incorrect due to gender mismatch.
    This kind of error arises in part because the later coreference decisions are not dependent on the earlier ones.
    In particular, had the model taken into consideration that &#8220;Mr.
    Clinton&#8221; 6Recently, however, Klenner and Ailloud (2009) have become less optimistic about ILP approaches to coreference. and &#8220;Clinton&#8221; were in the same cluster
