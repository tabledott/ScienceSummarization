  Figure 4 Sample bracketed text--after simplification, before correction.
  The process that creates the skeletal representations to be corrected by the anno- tators simplifies and flattens the structures shown in Figure 3 by removing POS tags, nonbranching lexical nodes, and certain phrasal nodes, notably NBAR.
  The output of the first automated stage of the bracketing task is shown in Figure 4.
  Annotators correct his simplified structure using a mouse-based interface.
  Their primary job is to "glue" fragments ogether, but they must also correct incorrect parses and delete some structure.
  Single mouse clicks perform the following tasks, among others.
  The interface correctly reindents the structure whenever necessary.
  Attach constituents labeled ?.
  This is done by pressing down the appropriate mouse button on or immediately after the ?, moving the mouse onto or immediately after the label of the intended par
