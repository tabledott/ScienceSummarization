i?1 = y ? Multi(?y) xi | yi = y ? Multi(?y) (1)We used the Forward-Backward algorithm to perform Expectation-Maximization, which is a procedure that iteratively re-estimates the model param eters (?, ?), converging on a local maximum of the likelihood.
			Specifically, if the parameter estimate attime ` is (?(`), ?(`)), then the re-estimated parame ters at time `+ 1 are: ?(`+1)y?|y = E[ny?,y]/E[ny] (2) ?(`+1)x|y = E[nx,y]/E[ny] 6.95E+06 7.00E+06 7.05E+06 7.10E+06 7.15E+06 0 250 500 750 1000 ? lo g lik el ih oo d Iteration Figure 1: Variation in negative log likelihood with increasing iterations for 10 EM runs from different random starting points.where nx,y is the number of times observation x oc curs with state y, ny?,y is the number of times state y?
