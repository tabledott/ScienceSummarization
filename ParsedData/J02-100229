   Both Pk and WD appear to solve the problem of underpenalizing false positives, but WD has the added benefit of being more stable across variations in segment size distribution.
    Thus, WD essentially solves Problems 1, 2, and 3.
    Table 1c shows that for the FNP segmentation (in which both false positives and false negatives occur), there is a disparity between the performances of Pk and WD.
    It appears that Pk is harsher in this situation.
    From the above discussion, we know that WD is more lenient in situations where a false negative and a false positive occur near each other (where &#8220;near&#8221; means within a distance of k2) than Pk is.
    However, Pk is more lenient for pure false positives that occur close to boundaries.
    Thus, it is not immediately clear why Pk is harsher in this situation, but a more detailed look provides the answer.
    Let us begin the analysis by trying to explain why Pk scores for the FNP segmentation make sense.
    The FNP segmentation places both false ne
