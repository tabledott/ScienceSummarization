 to improve the classifier.
			The analysis of the typesof errors made by human learners yields some insights which might be worthy of further investi gation.
			A clear one is the confusion between the three locative and temporal prepositions at, in, and on (typical sentence: The training programme will start at the 1st August).
			This type of error is made often by both learners and the model on both types of data, suggesting that perhaps further attentionto features might be necessary to improve discrim ination between these three prepositions.There are also interesting divergences.
			For ex ample, a common source of confusion in learners is between by and from, as in I like it becauseit?s from my favourite band.
			However, this confu sion is not very frequent in the model, a difference which could be explained either by the fact that, as noted above, performance on from is very low and so the classifier is unlikely to suggest it, or that in training the contexts seen for by are sufficiently distinctive
