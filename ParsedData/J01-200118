igram.
    In a test word, each space between letters (respectively, phonemes) is assigned a score that is the sum of the relevant values derived from the training session: in the word string, for example, the score for the potential cut between str and ing is the sum of three values: the probability of a morpheme boundary after tr (given tr), the probability of a morpheme boundary between r and i (given ri), and the probability of a morpheme boundary before in (given in).
    That these numbers should give some indication of the presence of a morpheme boundary is certain, for they are the sums of numbers that were explicitly assigned on the basis of overtly marked morpheme boundaries.
    But it remains unclear how one should proceed further with the sum.
    As Hafer and Weiss discover with Harris's measure, it is unclear whether local peaks of this measure should predict morpheme boundaries, or whether a threshold should be set, above which a morpheme boundary is predicted.
