 WSD undertaken in the context of their work on machine translation (see also Mahesh et al. [1997] and Mahesh, Nirenburg, and Beale [1997]).
    They access a large syntactic and semantic lexicon that provides detailed information about constraints, such as selectional restrictions, for words in a sentence, and then search a richly connected ontology to determine which senses of the target word best satisfy these constraints.
    They report a success rate of 97%.
    Like CORELEX, both the lexicon and the ontology are manually constructed, and therefore still limited, although much larger than the resources used in earlier work.
    However, Buitelaar (1997) describes means to automatically generate CORELEX entries from corpora in order to create domain-specific semantic lexicons, thus demonstrating the potential to access larger-scale resources of this kind.
