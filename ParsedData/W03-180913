pa (r.) score (Carletta, 1996) of .329.
    An initial analysis showed that two participants strongly disagreed with the other, achieving a mean pairwise r. score of less than .1.
    We decided therefore to remove these from the set before proceeding.
    The overall results for the remaining 26 participants can be seen in Table 2.
    The r. score over these 26 participants (.376) is classed as fair (0.2&#8211; 0.4) and approaching moderate (0.4&#8211;0.6) according to Altman (1991).
    As mentioned above, a major problem with lexical semantic studies is that items tend to occur with more than one meaning.
    In order to test the effects of polysemy in the example sentences on inter-annotator agreement, we analysed the agreement obtained over those VPCs which have only one meaning according to WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).
    There was a total of 14 such items, giving 28 entailment judgements (one for the verb and one for the particle in each item).
    For these items, mean agreement and the r. score w
