stage was to create resent dependency relations; the head of the final a mapping between the CCG dependencies and the 250 GRs.
    This involved mapping each argument slot in the 425 lexical categories in the CCG lexicon onto a GR.
    In the second stage, the GRs created from the parser output were post-processed to correct some of the obvious remaining differences between the CCG and GR representations.
    In the process of performing the transformation we encountered a methodological problem: without looking at examples it was difficult to create the mapping and impossible to know whether the two representations were converging.
    Briscoe et al. (2006) split the 700 sentences in DepBank into a test and development set, but the latter only consists of 140 sentences which was not enough to reliably create the transformation.
    There are some development files in the RASP release which provide examples of the GRs, which were used when possible, but these only cover a subset of the CCG lexical categories.
