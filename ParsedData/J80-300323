the achievement of the body.
    The constraints on the parameters consist of type specifications, and necessary parameter interdependencies.
    Each action has at least one parameter, namely, the agent or instigator of the action.
    In the blocks world, for example, the action of putting one block on top of another could be defined as: The preconditions, effects and body provide information to the plan construction and inference processes so that they can reason about the applicability and effect of performing the action in a given context.
    Finally, the body of the action specifies what steps must be achieved in the course of the execution of the action.
    Primitive actions have no bodies; their execution is specified by a non-examinable procedure.
    All agents are assumed to believe that actions achieve their effects and require their preconditions.
    We need the following axioms: For all agents a and b, and for all actions ACT, if PRE is the precondition of ACT and EFF its effect then: Every p
