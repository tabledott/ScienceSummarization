We therefore convert the word segmentation W into a word class sequence C. Eq.
    1 can then be rewritten as: Eq.
    2 is the basic form of the source-channel models for Chinese word segmentation.
    The models assume that a Chinese sentence S is generated as follows: First, a person chooses a sequence of concepts (i.e., word classes C) to output, according to the probability distribution P(C); then the person attempts to express each concept by choosing a sequence of characters, according to the probability distribution P(S|C).
    The source-channel models can be interpreted in another way as follows: P(C) is a stochastic model estimating the probability of word class sequence.
    It indicates, given a context, how likely a word class occurs.
    For example, person names are more likely to occur before a title such as &#25945;&#25480; &#8216;professor&#8217;.
    So P(C) is also referred to as context model afterwards.
    P(S|C) is a generative model estimating how likely a character string is generat
