atically partitioning a document into topics that includes explicit semantic information.
			Second, we show that, at least for one simple model of WSD,embedding a document in probabilistic latent struc ture, i.e., a ?topic,?
			can improve WSD.
			There are two avenues of research with LDAWN that we will explore.
			First, the statistical nature ofthis approach allows LDAWN to be used as a com ponent in larger models for other language tasks.Other probabilistic models of language could insert the ability to query synsets or paths of WORDNET.
			Similarly, any topic based information retrieval scheme could employ topics that include se mantically relevant (but perhaps unobserved) terms.Incorporating this model in a larger syntactically aware model, which could benefit from the local context as well as the document level context, is an important component of future research.
			Second, the results presented here show a marked improvement in accuracy as more topics are added to the baseline model, although the
