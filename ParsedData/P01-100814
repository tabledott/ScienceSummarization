araphrases.
    Identical words play two roles in this process: first, they are used to learn context rules; second, identical words are used in application of these rules, because the rules contain information about the equality of words in context.
    This method of co-training has been previously applied to a variety of natural language tasks, such as word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), lexicon construction for information extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999), and named entity classification (Collins and Singer, 1999).
    In our case, the co-training process creates a binary classifier, which predicts whether a given pair of phrases makes a paraphrase or not.
    Our model is based on the DLCoTrain algorithm proposed by (Collins and Singer, 1999), which applies a co-training procedure to decision list classifiers for two independent sets of features.
    In our case, one set of features describes the paraphrase pair itself, and another set of features corresponds to contexts in which paraphrases o
