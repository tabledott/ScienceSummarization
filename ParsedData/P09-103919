early&#8221; projective parses whenever that behavior is observed in the data.
    The multicommodity directed flow model of Magnanti and Wolsey (1994) is a refinement of the model described in &#167;3.1 which offers a compact and elegant way to indicate nonprojective arcs, requiring O(n3) variables and constraints.
    In this model, every node k =6 0 defines a commodity: one unit of commodity k originates at the root node and must be delivered to node k; the variable &#966;kij denotes the flow of commodity k in arc hi, ji.
    We first replace (4&#8211;9) by (18&#8211;22): where &#948;k j, ff(j = k) is the Kronecker delta.
    We next define auxiliary variables &#968;jk that indicate if there is a path from j to k. Since each vertex except the root has only one incoming arc, the following linear equalities are enough to describe these new variables: a , ff(a &#8712; y and a is nonprojective).
    From the definition of projective arcs in &#167;2.1, we have that znp There are other ways to introduce nonproje
