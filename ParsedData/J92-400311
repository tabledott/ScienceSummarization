els, we choose the As to depend on the history, w1, only through the count of the 2gram, We expect that where the count of the 2-gram is high, the 3-gram estimates will be reliable, and, where the count is low, the estimates will be unreliable.
    We have constructed an interpolated 3-gram model in which we have divided the As into 1,782 different sets according to the 2-gram counts.
    We estimated these As from a held-out sample of 4,630,934 words.
    We measure the performance of our model on the Brown corpus, which contains a variety of English text and is not included in either our training or held-out data (Kiera and Francis 1967).
    The Brown corpus contains 1,014,312 words and has a perplexity of 244 with respect to our interpolated model.
  
  
    Clearly, some words are similar to other words in their meaning and syntactic function.
    We would not be surprised to learn that the probability distribution of words in the vicinity of Thursday is very much like that for words in the vicinity of F
