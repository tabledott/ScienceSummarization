hur))) The VP rule requires that the agr feature of the DAG associated with the VP be the same as (unified with) the agr of the V. Thus, the VP's agr feature will have as its value the same node as the V's agr, and hence the same values for the person and number features.
    Similarly, by virtue of the unification associated with the S rule, the NP will have the same agr value as the VP and, consequently, the V. We have thus encoded a form of subject-verb agreement.
    Note that the process of unification is order-independent.
    For instance, we would get the same effect regardless of whether the unifications at the top of the parse tree were effected before or after those at the bottom.
    In either case, the DAG associated with, e.g., the VP node would be These trivial examples of grammars and lexicons offer but a glimpse of the techniques used in writing PATR-H grammars, arid do not begin to employ the power of unification as a general information-passing mechanism.
