ecause they often really are two separate concepts (as in pork, pig) and each sense may have different synonyms (pork meat is only synonym to pork).
    However, the polysemy pointer additionally allows the recognition of statistically infrequent uses of a word sense created by regular polysemy.
    So for example the sentence I had crocodile for hutch is very infrequent in that crocodile is not commonly perceived as meat but only as animal.
    Nevertheless we know that a regular polysemy exists between meat and animal.
    Therefore we can reconstruct via the regular polysemy pointer that the meat sense is referred to in this particular sentence even though it is not explicitly encoded.
    Thus the pointer can be conceived of as an implementation of a simple default via which the net can account for language productivity and regularity in an effective manner.
    Adjectives in GermaNet are modeled in a taxonornical manner making heavy use of the hyponymy relation, which is very different from the satellite
