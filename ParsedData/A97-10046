amp;quot; used are: The information this model would use for Example 1 would be: PreviousWord=ANLP, FollowingWord=chairmon, Prefix=Corp, Suffix=NULL, PrefixFeature=InducedAbbreviation.
    The abbreviation list is automatically produced from the training data, and the contextual questions are also automatically generated by scanning the training data. with question templates.
    As a. result, no hand-crafted rules or lists are required by the highly portable system and it can be easily retrained for other languages or text genres.
  
  
    The model used here for sentence-boundary detection is based on the maximum entropy model used for POS tagging in (Ratna.parkhi, 1996).
    For each potential sentence boundary token (., ?, and !
    ), we estimate a. joint, probability distribution p of the token and its surrounding context, both of which are denoted by c, occurring as an actual sentence boundary.
    The distribution is given by: p(b, c) = Ir &#8222;,,,.f-(b&#8222;c), where b e no, yes}, where the cri's
