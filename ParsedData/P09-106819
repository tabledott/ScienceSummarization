    FrameNet frames share commonalities with narrative schemas; both represent aspects of situations in the world, and both link semantically related words into frame-like sets in which each predicate draws its argument roles from a frame-specific set.
    They differ in that schemas focus on events in a narrative, while frames focus on events that share core participants.
    Nonetheless, the fact that FrameNet defines frame-specific argument roles suggests that comparing our schemas and roles to FrameNet would be elucidating.
    We took the 20 learned narrative schemas described in the previous section and used FrameNet to perform qualitative evaluations on three aspects of schema: verb groupings, linking structure (the mapping of each argument role to syntactic subject or object), and the roles themselves (the set of entities that constitutes the schema roles).
    Verb groupings To compare a schema&#8217;s event selection to a frame&#8217;s lexical units, we first map the top 20 schemas to the F
