 a sample as &#8220;A&#8221; if the Japanese and English sentences of the sample shared a common event (approximately a clause).
    &#8220;D&#8221; consisted of the samples not belonging to &#8220;A&#8221;.
    The results of evaluation are in Table 6.9 This table shows that the number of A&#8217;s decreases rapidly as the rank increases.
    This means that SntScore ranks appropriate one-to-one alignments highly.
    The table indicates that the top-150,000 oneto-one alignments are sufficiently reliable.10 The ratio of A&#8217;s in these alignments was 0.982.
    We then evaluated precision for one-to-many alignments by sorting them in decreasing order of SntScore.
    We classified one-to-many into three categories: &#8220;1-90000&#8221;, &#8220;90001-180000&#8221;, and &#8220;180001270000&#8221;, each of which was covered by the range of SntScore of one-to-one that was presented in Table 6.
    We randomly sampled 100 one-to-many alignments from these categories and judged them to be A or D (see Table 7).
