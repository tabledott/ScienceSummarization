    As for future work, there are still possibilities made available by TAG which remain to be explored.
    One, also suggested by (Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000), is to group elementary trees into families and relate the trees of a family by transformations.
    For example, one would imagine that the distribution of active verbs and their subjects would be similar to the distribution of passive verbs and their notional subjects, yet they are treated as independent in the current model.
    If the two configurations could be related, then the sparseness of verb-argument dependencies would be reduced.
    Another possibility is the use of multiplyanchored trees.
    Nothing about PTAG requires that elementary trees have only a single anchor (or any anchor at all), so multiplyanchored trees could be used to make, for example, the attachment of a PP dependent not only on the preposition (as in the current model) but the lexical head of the prepositional object as well, or the attachment of a relative clause d
