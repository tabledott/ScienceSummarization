  Preliminary results using the DSM model are very promising.
  Using a corpus of newswire data, and only considering relative clause and apposi- tive simplification, we correctly recovered 25 out of 28 relative clauses and i4 of 14 appositives.
  We generated 1 spurious relative clause and 2 spuri- ous appositives.
  A version of the FSG model on the same data  recovered 17 relative clauses and 3 appositives.
  6 Discuss ion Simplification can be used for two general (:lasses of tasks.
  The first is as a preprocessor to a flfll parser so as to reduce ];he parse ambiguity for the parser.
  Tile second class of tasks demands that the output of the simplifier be free-standing sen- tences.
  Maintaining the coherence of the simpli- fied text raises the fbllowing problems: ?
  Determining the relative order of the simpli- fied sentences, which impacts the choice of referring expressions to be used and the over- all coherence of the text.
  Choosing referring expressions: For instance, when separating relative
