tion and MT decoding.
    One way to improve the consistency of the CRF model is to make use of external lexicons (which are not part of the segmentation training data) to add lexicon-based features.
    All the features we use are listed in Table 6.
    Our linguistic features are adopted from (Ng and Low, 2004) and (Tseng et al., 2005).
    There are three categories of features: character identity n-grams, morphological and character reduplication features.
    Our lexicon-based features are adopted from (Shi and Wang, 2007), where LBegin(C0), LMid(C0) and LEnd(C0) represent the maximum length of words found in a lexicon that contain the current character as either the first, middle or last character, and we group any length equal or longer than 6 together.
    The linguistic features help capturing words that were unseen to the segmenter; while the lexicon-based features constrain the segmenter with external knowledge of what sequences are likely to be words.
    We built a CRF segmenter with all the feat
