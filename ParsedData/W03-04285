    Here we have a slight complexity: by the notation, one would expect such emissions to have probability 1, since nothing else can be emitted from a final state.
    In practice, we have a special stop symbol in our n-gram counts, and the probability of emitting a space from a final state is the probability of the n-gram having chosen the stop character.3 models.
    The value was the empirically optimal order.
    3This can be cleaned up conceptually by considering the entire process to have been a hierarchical HMM (Fine et al., 1998), where the -gram model generates the entire phrase, followed by a tier pop up to the phrase transition tier.
    Using this model, we tested two variants, one in which preceding context was discarded (for example, was turned into ), and another where context was used as outlined above.
    For comparison, we also built a first-order word-level HMM; the results are shown in table 1.
    We give F both per-category and overall.
    The word-level model and the (context disa
