No smaller alignments are possible because the clause &amp;quot;... sales ... were higher... &amp;quot; in the first English sentence corresponds to (part of) the second French sentence.
    The next two alignments below illustrate the more typical case where one English sentence aligns with exactly one French sentence.
    The final alignment matches two English sentences to a single French sentence.
    These alignments agreed with the results produced by a human judge.
    Aligning sentences is just a first step toward constructing a probabilistic dictionary (Table 3) for use in aligning words in machine translation (Brown et al. 1990), or for constructing a bilingual concordance (Table 4) for use in lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990).
    Although there has been some previous work on the sentence alignment (e.g., Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991 [at IBM], Kay and Roscheisen [this issue; at Xerox], and Catizone, Russell, and Warwick, in press Eat ISSCO], the alignment task remains a significant obstacl
