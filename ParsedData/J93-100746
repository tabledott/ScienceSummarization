 et al. (1989, 1991) have yet another approach; they consider questions such as what does a boat typically do?
    They are preprocessing a corpus with the Fidditch parser (Hindle 1983) in order to produce a list of verbs that are most likely associated with the subject &amp;quot;boat.&amp;quot; Our goal here is different, as we analyze collocations automatically produced by the first stage of Xtract to either add syntactic information or reject them.
    For example, if a lexical relation identified at stage 1 involves a noun and a verb, the role of stage 3 is to determine whether it is a subject&#8212;verb or a verb&#8212;object collocation.
    If no such consistent relation is observed, then the collocation is rejected.
    Stage 3 uses a parser but it does not require a complete parse tree.
    Given a number of sentences, Xtract only needs to know pairwise syntactic (modifier&#8212;modified) relations.
    The parser we used in the experiment reported here is Cass (Abney 1989, 1990), a bottom-up increme
