find an analysis in which the i is integrated into the stem itself.
    This is what the algorithm does, employing the stem ecri for the words ecri-re and Ecri-t. Ecrit in turn is the stem for ecrite, ecrite, ecrites, ecrits, and ecriture.
    An alternate stem form ecriv is used for past tense forms (and the nominalization ecrivain) with the suffixes aient, ait, ant, irent, it.
    The algorithm does not make explicit the connection between these two stems, as it ideally would.
    Thus in the tables, Good indicates the categories of words where the analysis was clearly right, while the incorrect analyses have been broken into several categories.
    Wrong Analysis is for bimorphemic words that are analyzed, but incorrectly analyzed, by the algorithm.
    Failed to Analyze are the cases of words that are bimorphemic but 29 My inability to determine the correct morphological analysis in a wide range of words that I know perfectly well seems to me to be essentially the same response as has often been observed
