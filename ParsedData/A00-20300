  A Novel Use Of Statistical Parsing To Extract Information From Text
  
    Since 1995, a few statistical parsing algorithms have demonstrated a breakthrough in parsing accuracy, as measured against the UPenn TREEBANK as a gold standard.
    In this paper we report adapting a lexic al ized, probabilistic context-free parser to information extraction and evaluate this new technique on MUC-7 template elements and template relations.
  
  
    Since 1995, a few statistical parsing algorithms (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1996 and 1997; Charniak, 1997; Rathnaparki, 1997) demonstrated a breakthrough in parsing accuracy, as measured against the University of Pennsylvania TREEBANK as a gold standard.
    Yet, relatively few have embedded one of these algorithms in a task.
    Chiba, (1999) was able to use such a parsing algorithm to reduce perplexity with the long term goal of improved speech recognition.
    In this paper, we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFG-HR)
