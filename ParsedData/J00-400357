call is extremely low (12%); we also get the worst precision.
    In other words, considering only indefinites for the resolution of definite descriptions is too restrictive; this is because our corpus contains a large number of first-mention definite descriptions that serve as antecedents for subsequent references (similar results were also reported in Fraurud [1990]).
    The version with the highest precision (88%) is the one that only considers indefinites and definite descriptions as antecedents, but recall is lower compared to the version that considered other NPs.
    We chose, as the basis for further testing, a version that combines near-optimal values for F and precision, i.e., the version that takes indefinites, definite descriptions, and possessives (first row in Table 8).
    5.2.3 Premodifiers.
    Finally, we tested our heuristics for dealing with premodifiers.
    We tested the matching algorithm from Vieira and Poesio (1996) in the present version of the system; the results are presented in T
