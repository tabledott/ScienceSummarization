publication of our method (Dagan, Itai, and Schwa11 1991) was cited several times as requiring a parallel bilingual corpus.
  
  
    Our approach is first to use a bilingual lexicon to find all possible translations of each lexically ambiguous word in the source sentence and then use statistical information gathered from target language corpora to choose the most appropriate alternative.
    To carry out this task we need the following linguistic tools, which are discussed in detail in the following sections: Section 2.1: Parsers for both the source language and the target language.
    These parsers should be capable of locating relevant syntactic relations, such as subj&#8212;verb, verb&#8212;obj, etc.
    Section 2.2: A bilingual lexicon that lists alternative translations for each source language word.
    If a word belongs to several syntactic categories, there should be a separate list for each one.
    Section 2.3: A procedure for mapping the source language syntactic relations to those of the target
