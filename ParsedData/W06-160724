st obvious characteristic is that this method appears to be highly sensitive to the particular corpus sample used.
  
  
    We tested different phrasetable smoothing techniques in two different translation settings: European language pairs with relatively small corpora, and Chinese to English translation with large corpora.
    The smoothing techniques fall into two categories: black-box methods that work only on phrase-pair counts; and glass-box methods that decompose phrase probabilities into lexical probabilities.
    In our implementation, black-box techniques use linear interpolation to combine relative frequency estimates with smoothing distributions, while glass-box techniques are combined in loglinear fashion with either relative-frequencies or black-box estimates.
    All smoothing techniques tested gave statistically significant gains over pure relative-frequency estimates.
    In the small-corpus setting, the best technique is a loglinear combination of KneserNey count smoothing with Zens-Ney glas
