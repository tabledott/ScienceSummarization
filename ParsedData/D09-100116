 four formulas: All free variables are implicitly universally quantified.
    The &#8220;+&#8221; notation signifies that the MLN contains an instance of the formula, with a separate weight, for each value combination of the 2Currently, we do not handle quantifier scoping or semantics for specific closed-class words such as determiners.
    These will be pursued in future work. variables with a plus sign.
    The first formula models the mixture of core forms given the cluster, and the others model the mixtures of argument forms, argument types, and argument numbers, respectively, given the argument type.
    To encourage clustering and avoid overfitting, we impose an exponential prior with weight &#945; on the number of parameters.4 The MLN above has one problem: it often clusters expressions that are semantically opposite.
    For example, it clusters antonyms like &#8220;elderly/young&#8221;, &#8220;mature/immature&#8221;.
    This issue also occurs in other semantic-processing systems (e.g., DIRT).
