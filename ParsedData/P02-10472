    Unfortunately, the state of the art in NLP does not provide us access to semantic interpreters and general purpose knowledge bases that would support these kinds of inferences.
    The discourse relation definitions proposed by others (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Knott and Sanders, 1998) are not easier to apply either because they assume the ability to automatically derive, in addition to the semantics of the text spans, the intentions and illocutions associated with them as well.
    In spite of the difficulty of determining the discourse relations that hold between arbitrary text spans, it is clear that such an ability is important in many appli
