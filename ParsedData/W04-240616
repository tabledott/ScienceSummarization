lusions are based on experiments conducted with smaller data sets, and that with larger data sets partitional algorithms are not only faster but lead to better results.
    In particular, Zhao and Karypis recommend a hybrid approach known as Repeated Bisections.
    This overcomes the main weakness with partitional approaches, which is the instability in clustering solutions due to the choice of the initial random centroids.
    Repeated Bisections starts with all instances in a single cluster.
    At each iteration it selects one cluster whose bisection optimizes the chosen criteria function.
    The cluster is bisected using standard K-means method with K=2, while the criteria function maximizes the similarity between each instance and the centroid of the cluster to which it is assigned.
    As such this is a hybrid method that combines a hierarchical divisive approach with partitioning.
