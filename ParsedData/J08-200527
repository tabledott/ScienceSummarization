gs from consideration.
  266 Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih Importance of Parsing and Inference in SRL Here, we are concerned with global constraints as well as constraints on the arguments.
  Therefore, the final labeling becomes c?1:M = argmax c1:M?F (PM ) M ?
  i=1 score(Si = ci) (2) When the confidence scores correspond to the conditional probabilities estimated by the argument classifiers, the value of the objective function represents the expected number of correct argument predictions.
  Hence, the solution of Equation (2) is the one that maximizes this expected value among all legitimate outputs.
  The filter function used considers the following constraints:1 1.
  Arguments cannot overlap with the predicate.
  Arguments cannot exclusively overlap with the clauses.
  If a predicate is outside a clause, its arguments cannot be embedded in that clause.
  No overlapping or embedding arguments.
  This constraint holds because semantic arguments are labeled on non-embedding constituents in the syntactic parse t
