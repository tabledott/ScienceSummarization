double letters), and a single letter can sometimes produce two phonemes (double phonemes).
    To help address these problems, we propose an automatic many-to-many aligner and incorporate it into a generic classification predictor for letter-tophoneme conversion.
    Our many-to-many aligner automatically discovers double phonemes and double letters, as opposed to manually preprocessing data by merging phonemes using fixed lists.
    To our knowledge, applying many-to-many alignments to letter-to-phoneme conversion is novel.
    Once we have our many-to-many alignments, we use that data to train a prediction model.
    Many phoneme prediction systems are based on local prediction methods, which focus on predicting an individual phoneme given each letter in a word.
    Conversely, a method like pronunciation by analogy (PbA) (Marchand and Damper, 2000) is considered a global prediction method: predicted phoneme sequences are considered as a whole.
