29, risk 0.126, influence 0.125; The frequency counts and mutual information values of &amp;quot;economic impact&amp;quot; and phrases obtained by replacing one of &amp;quot;economic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;impact&amp;quot; with a similar word are in Table 4.
    Not only many combinations are found in the corpus, many of them have very similar mutual information values to that of nomial distribution can be accurately approximated by a normal distribution (Dunning, 1993).
    Since all the potential non-compositional expressions that we are considering have reasonably large frequency counts, we assume their distributions are normal.
    Let 'head type modifierj = k and 1* * *1 = n. The maximum likelihood estimation of the true probability p of the collocation (head type modifier) is = k -n .
    Even though we do not know what p is, since p is (assumed to be) normally distributed, there is N% chance that it fails within the interval where zN is a constant related to the confidence level N and the last step in
