   (Charniak, 2000) claims that a similar strategy proved effective for WSJ parsing.
  
  
    Even narrow-coverage context-free natural language grammars produce explosive ambiguity (Church and Patil, 1982).
    Today's treebankderived broad-coverage CFGs generate even more, some of it genuine linguistic ambiguity and some of it artificial (see (Krotov et al., 1998) and (Johnson, 1998) for discussion).
    Corpusbased statistical parsing is a leading technique to deal with this extreme ambiguity; the vast bulk of work in this field has been done in English, using the Wall Street Journal section of the English Penn Treebank (ETB).
    State-ofthe-art statistical parsing techniques now handle most ambiguity adequately; the best statistical parsers for the ETB are now at roughly 90% labeled bracketing accuracy (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000).
    The remaining difficult-toresolve ambiguities are fairly well-understood for English perhaps the best-known are flat versus embedded adjunction structures (see (Johnso
