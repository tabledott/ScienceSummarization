xample, the MWE fire breathing.
    This expression is clearly compositional, as it denotes the process of producing combusting exhalation, exactly what the semantic combination rules of the English would predict.
    Nevertheless the distribution of fire breathing is quite unrelated to that of its constituents fire and breathing ( the former appears frequently with dragon and circus while the later appear frequently with blaze and lungs, respectively).
    Despite these principled objections, the composed vector provides a useful baseline for our investigation.
    We should note that a number of researchers in the LSA tradition have attempted to provide more compelling combinatory functions to capture the non-linearity of linguistic compositional interpretation (Kintsch, 2001; Widdows and Peters, 2003).
    As a check we chose, at random, a number of simple clearly-compositional word combinations (not from the candidate MWE list).
    We expected that on the whole these would evidence a very high similarity
