  dry-run test set which served as our principal source of data for NE training and self-evaluation .
  To be precise, our final dry-run P&amp;R score prior to the MUC-6 evaluation run was 91.8, a scant o.6 higher than the officially measured evaluation score.
  The fact that the score dropped so little is encouraging to us .
  On the template elements task, our initial TE score was P&amp;R=78 .5, and our revised official score was 77.
  Once again, this performance is encouragingly close to Alembics performance on our final self-evaluation using the formal training data set .
  By the non-revised metric, we achieved a performance of P&amp;R=80.2 on the training data, with an overall drop of 1 .7 points ofP&amp;R between training and official test.
