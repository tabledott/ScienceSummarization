 parse a sentence instead of single actions (Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang and Sagae, 2010; Zhang and Clark, 2011; Zhang and Nivre, 2011; Bohnet, 2011).
    In addition, a number of different transition systems have been proposed, in particular for dealing with non-projective dependencies, which were beyond the scope of early systems (Attardi, 2006; Nivre, 2007; Nivre, 2009; Titov et al., 2009).
    In this section, we start by defining a transition system for joint tagging and parsing based on the non-projective transition system proposed in Nivre (2009).
    We then show how to perform beam search and structured online learning with this model, and conclude by discussing feature representations.
    Given a set P of part-of-speech tags and a set D of dependency labels, a tagged dependency tree for a sentence x = w1, ... , wn is a directed tree T = (Vx, A) with labeling functions 7r and 6 such that: The set Vx of nodes is the set of positive integers up to and including n, each corresponding to the linear pos
