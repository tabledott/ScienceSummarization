 the theory described in Wilks (1978) has not been implemented, though the projection algorithm was implemented (Modiano 1986) using some parts of CS to supply detail missing from Wilks' original specification.
    Gentner's (1983) Structure-Mapping Theory has no treatment of metonymy.
    The theory has been implemented in the Structure-Mapping Engine (Falkenhainer, Forbus and Gentner 1989) and some examples analyzed by it but not, to my knowledge, examples of metaphor or anomaly.
    Indurkhya's (1988) Constrained Semantic Transference theory of metaphor has no treatment of metonymy, anomaly or literalness.
    It has also not been implemented: see Indurkhya (1987) for reasons why.
    Hobbs and Martin (1987) offer a relatively shallow treatment of metonymy without, for instance, acknowledgement that metonymies can be driven from either the source or the target.
    Hobbs' &amp;quot;selective inferencing&amp;quot; approach to text interpretation has been applied to problems including lexical ambiguity (Hobb
