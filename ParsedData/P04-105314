set manually and identified the relations for two different domains.
    One was the PERSON-GPE (PER-GPE) domain.
    We obtained 177 distinct NE pairs and classified them into 38 classes (relations) manually.
    The other was the COMPANY-COMPANY (COM-COM) domain.
    We got 65 distinct NE pairs and classified them into 10 classes manually.
    However, the types of both arguments of a relation are the same in the COM-COM domain.
    So the COM-COM domain includes symmetrical relations as well as asymmetrical relations.
    For the latter, we have to distinguish the different orders of arguments.
    We show the types of classes and the number in each class in Table 1.
    The errors in NE tagging were eliminated to evaluate our method correctly.
  
  
    We evaluated separately the placement of the NE pairs into clusters and the assignment of labels to these clusters.
    In the first step, we evaluated clusters consisting of two or more pairs.
    For each cluster, we determined the relation (R) of the cl
