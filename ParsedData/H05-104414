wo-step approach to contextual polarity dis ambiguation.
			For the first step, we concentrate on whether clue instances are neutral or polar in context (where polar in context refers to having a contextual polarity that is positive, negative or both).
			For the second step, we take all clue instances marked aspolar in step one, and focus on identifying their contextual polarity.
			For both steps, we develop classi fiers using the BoosTexter AdaBoost.HM (Schapire and Singer, 2000) machine learning algorithm with5000 rounds of boosting.
			The classifiers are evalu ated in 10-fold cross-validation experiments.
			6.3.1 Neutral-Polar Classification The neutral-polar classifier uses 28 features, listed in Table 3.
			Word Features: Word context is a bag of three word tokens: the previous word, the word itself, and the next word.
			The prior polarity and reliability class are indicated in the lexicon.Modification Features: These are binary rela tionship features.
			The first four involve relationships with th
