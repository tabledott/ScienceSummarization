 word reordering and the existence of an efficient dynamic programming decoding algorithm.
    However, when phrase-based systems are used between languages with very different word orders, such as between subject-verb-object (SVO) and subject-object-verb (SOV) languages, long distance reordering becomes one of the key weaknesses.
    Many reordering methods have been proposed in recent years to address this problem in different aspects.
    The first class of approaches tries to explicitly model phrase reordering distances.
    Distance based distortion model (Och, 2002; Koehn et.al., 2003) is a simple way of modeling phrase level reordering.
    It penalizes non-monotonicity by applying a weight to the number of words between two source phrases corresponding to two consecutive target phrases.
    Later on, this model was extended to lexicalized phrase reordering (Tillmann, 2004; Koehn, et.al., 2005; Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006) by applying different weights to different phrases.
