us especially in Japanese morphological analysis due to hierarchical tagsets as well as word boundary ambiguity.
    The key advantage of CRFs is their flexibility to include a variety of features while avoiding these bias.
    In what follows, we describe our motivations of applying CRFs to Japanese morphological analysis (Section 2).
    Then, CRFs and their parameter estimation are provided (Section 3).
    Finally, we discuss experimental results (Section 4) and give conclusions with possible future directions (Section 5).
  
  
    Word boundary ambiguity cannot be ignored when dealing with non-segmented languages.
    A simple approach would be to let a character be a token (i.e., character-based Begin/Inside tagging) so that boundary ambiguity never occur (Peng et al., 2004).

    However, B/I tagging is not a standard method in 20-year history of corpus-based Japanese morphological analysis.
    This is because B/I tagging cannot directly ref
