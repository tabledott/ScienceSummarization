onolingual parallel corpus used by Barzilay and McKeown (2001).
    The words in each sentence pair from this corpus are then aligned automatically to produce the initial paraphrase annotations that are then refined by two human annotators.
    The annotation guidelines required that the annotators judge which parts of a given sentence pair were in correspondence and to indicate this by creating an alignment between those parts (or correcting already existing alignments, if present).
    Two parts were said to correspond if they could be substituted for each other within the specific context provided by the respective sentence pair.
    In addition, the annotators were instructed to classify the created alignments as either sure (the two parts are clearly substitutable) or possible (the two parts are slightly divergent either in terms of syntax or semantics).
    For example, given the following paraphrastic sentence pair: the phrase pair (the convention, the meeting) will be aligned as a sure correspondence
