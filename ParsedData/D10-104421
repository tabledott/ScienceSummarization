ssing among other possibilities the use of unlabelled IN data, which is applicable to SMT settings where source-only IN corpora are available.
    It is also worth pointing out a connection with Daum&#180;e&#8217;s (2007) work that splits each feature into domain-specific and general copies.
    At first glance, this seems only peripherally related to our work, since the specific/general distinction is made for features rather than instances.
    However, for multinomial models like our LMs and TMs, there is a one to one correspondence between instances and features, eg the correspondence between a phrase pair (s, t) and its conditional multinomial probability p(s1t).
    As mentioned above, it is not obvious how to apply Daum&#180;e&#8217;s approach to multinomials, which do not have a mechanism for combining split features.
    Recent work by Finkel and Manning (2009) which re-casts Daum&#180;e&#8217;s approach in a hierarchical MAP framework may be applicable to this problem.
