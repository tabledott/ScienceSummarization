longer spans with the recurrence given by equations (3) and (4).
    Once the inside and outside probabilities computed for each sentence in the corpus, the reestimated probability of binary rules, Bp,qx , and the reestimated probability of unary rules, are computed by the reestimation formulas (5) and (6), which are just like the original ones (Baker, 1979; Jelinek et al., 1990; Lan i and Young, 1990) except for the use of bracketed strings instead of unbracketed ones.
    The denominator of ratios (5) and (6) estimates the probability that a compatible derivation of a bracketed string in C will involve at least one expansion of nonterminal Ap.
    The numerator of (5) estimates the probability that a compatible derivation of a bracketed string in C will involve rule Ap Aq Ar, while the numerator of (6) estimates the probability that a compatible derivation of a string in C will rewrite Ap to bm.
    Thus (5) estimates the probability that a rewrite of Ap in a compatible derivation of a bracketed string in C
