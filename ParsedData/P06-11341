between subjectivity and word sense.
    There are several benefits that would motivate such a joint exploration.
    First, at the resource level, the augmentation of lexical resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) with subjectivity labels could support better subjectivity analysis tools, and principled methods for refining word senses and clustering similar meanings.
    Second, at the tool level, an explicit link between subjectivity and word sense could help improve methods for each, by integrating features learned from one into the other in a pipeline approach, or through joint simultaneous learning.
    In this paper we address two questions about word sense and subjectivity.
    First, can subjectivity labels be assigned to word senses?
    To address this question, we perform two studies.
    The first (Section 3) investigates agreement between annotators who manually assign the labels subjective, objective, or both to WordNet senses.
    The second study (Section 4) evaluates a method for automatic
