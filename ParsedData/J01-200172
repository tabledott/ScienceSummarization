  We return to the matter of triage below.
    We are currently experimenting with methods to improve the identification of related stems.
    Current efforts yield interesting but inconclusive results.
    We compare all pairs of stems to determine whether they can be related by a simple substitution process (one letter for none, one letter for one letter, one letter for two letters), ignoring those pairs that are related by virtue of one being the stem of the other already within the analysis.
    We collect all such rules, and compare by frequency.
    In a 500,000-word English corpus, the top two such pairs of 1:1 relationships are (1) 46 stems related by a final d/ s alternation, including intrud/intrus, apprendend/apprenhens, provid/provis, suspend/sus pens, and elud/elus, and (2) 43 stems related by a final i/ y alternation, including reli/rely, ordinari/ordinary, decri/decry, suppli/supply, and accompani/accompany.
    This approach can quickly locate patterns of allomorphy that are well known in the
