ACE Feb&#8217;2002 and ACE Sept&#8217;2003 evaluation sets.
    We obtained competitive results shown in Table 4.

    We have presented a statistical approach for extracting relations where we combine diverse lexical, syntactic, and semantic features.
    We obtained competitive results on the ACE RDC task.
    Several previous relation extraction systems have focused almost exclusively on syntactic parse trees.
    We believe our approach of combining many kinds of evidence can potentially scale better to problems (like ACE), where we have a lot of relation types with relatively small amounts of annotated data.
    Our system certainly benefits from features derived from parse trees, but it is not inextricably linked to them.
    Even using very simple lexical features, we obtained high precision extractors that can potentially be used to annotate large amounts of unlabeled data for
