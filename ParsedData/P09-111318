red instances.
    This means that 900,000 Freebase relation instances are used in training, and 900,000 are held out.
    These experiments used 800,000 Wikipedia articles in the training phase and 400,000 different articles in the testing phase.
    For human evaluation experiments, all 1.8 million relation instances are used in training.
    Again, we use 800,000 Wikipedia articles in the training phase and 400,000 different articles in the testing phase.
    For all our experiments, we only extract relation instances that do not appear in our training data, i.e., instances that are not already in Freebase.
    Our system needs negative training data for the purposes of constructing the classifier.
    Towards this end, we build a feature vector in the training phase for an &#8216;unrelated&#8217; relation by randomly selecting entity pairs that do not appear in any Freebase relation and extracting features for them.
    While it is possible that some of these entity pairs on the 102 largest relations we u
