533; &#183; O(x), where O(x) is a feature representation and w&#65533; is a weight vector.
    We write Oact(i) to denote the feature representation extracted for action act at location i.
    The model is trained using a variant of the structured perceptron (Collins, 2002), similar to the algorithm of (Shen et al., 2007; Shen and Joshi, 2008).
    As usual, we use parameter averaging to prevent the perceptron from overfitting.
    The training algorithm is initialized with a zero parameter vector w. The algorithm makes several passes over the data.
    At each pass, we apply the training procedure given in Algorithm 2 to every sentence in the training set.
    At training time, each sentence is parsed using the parsing algorithm and the current w. Whenever an invalid action is chosen by the parsing algorithm, it is not performed (line 6).
    Instead, we update the parameter vector w&#65533; by decreasing the weights of the features associated with the invalid action, and increasing the weights for the curre
