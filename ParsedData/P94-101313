    However, if additional language resources are available, it may be desirable to include a larger feature set.
    For example, if lemmatization procedures are available, collocational measures for morphological roots will tend to yield more succinct and generalizable evidence than measuring the distributions for each of the inflected forms.
    If part-of-speech information is available in a lexicon, it is useful to compute the 'The term collocation is used here in its broad sense, meaning words appearing adjacent to or near each other (literally, in the same location), and does not imply only idiomatic or non-compositional associations. distributions for part-of-speech bigrams and trigrams as above.
    Note that it's not necessary to determine the actual parts-of-speech of words in context; using only the most likely part of speech or a set of all possibilities will produce adeq
