    In order to determine the probability of a noun, the probability of a class is assumed to be distributed uniformly among the members of that class: Since WordNet is a hierarchy with noun senses, rather than nouns, at the nodes, Li and Abe deal with the issue of word sense ambiguity using the method described in Section 3, by dividing the count for a noun equally among the concepts whose synsets contain the noun.
    Also, since WordNet is a DAG, Li and Abe turn WordNet into a tree by copying each subgraph with multiple parents.
    And so that each noun in the data appears (in a synset) at a leaf node, Li and Abe remove those parts of the hierarchy dominated by a noun in the data (but only for that instance of WordNet corresponding to the relevant verb).
    An example cut showing part of the WordNet hierarchy is shown in Figure 3 (based on an example from Li and Abe [1998]; the dashed lines i
