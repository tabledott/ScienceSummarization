    We cannot avail ourselves of this. solution because of the flatness of our notation.
    The predicate rise is surely referentially transparent, so if ES and Af S are identical, MS can he substituted for ES in the expression ristii(P, , ES) to give riselP,&#8222;t/S).
    Then the expression believe( J, Pt) would not even require substitution to he a belief about the Morning Star.
    In any case, this approach does not seem wise in view of the central importance played in discourse interpretation by the identity of differently presented entities, i.e. by coreference.
    Free intersubstitutibility of identicals seems a desirable property to preserve.
    The second possible answer to Frege's problem is to say that in the Platonic universe, the Morning Star and the Evening Star 'This 4 a purely syntactic approach, and when one tries to construct a semantics for it, one is generally driven to the third possibility. are different entities.
    It just happens that in the real world they are identica
