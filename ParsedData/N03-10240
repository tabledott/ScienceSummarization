  Syntax-Based Alignment Of Multiple Translations: Extracting Paraphrases And Generating New Sentences
  
    We describe a syntax-based algorithm that automatically builds Finite State Automata (word lattices) from semantically equivalent translation sets.
    These FSAs are good representations of paraphrases.
    They can be used to extract lexical and syntactic paraphrase pairs and to generate new, unseen sentences that express the same meaning as the sentences in the input sets.
    Our FSAs can also predict the correctness of alternative semantic renderings, which may be used to evaluate the quality of translations.
  
  
    In the past, paraphrases have come under the scrutiny of many research communities.
    Information retrieval researchers have used paraphrasing techniques for query reformulation in order to increase the recall of information retrieval engines (Sparck Jones and Tait, 1984).
    Natural language generation researchers have used paraphrasing to increase the expressive power of gene
