ew hard cases that arise can be handled completely locally.
    For example, in the baseNP tag set, whenever a B tag immediately follows an 0, it must be treated as an I, and, in the partitioning chunk tag set, wherever a V tag immediately follows an N tag without any intervening By, it must be treated as a By.
    Transformational learning begins with some initial &amp;quot;baseline&amp;quot; prediction, which here means a baseline assignment of chunk tags to words.
    Reasonable suggestions for baseline heuristics after a text has been tagged for part-of-speech might include assigning to each word the chunk tag that it carried most frequently in the training set, or assigning each part-of-speech tag the chunk tag that was most frequently associated with that part-of-speech tag in the training.
    We tested both approaches, and the baseline heuristic using part-of-speech tags turned out to do better, so it was the one used in our experiments.
    The part-of-speech tags used by this baseline heuristic, and
