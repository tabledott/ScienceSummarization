  The EuTRANs-II corpus is a natural German-English corpus consisting of different text types belonging to the domain of tourism: bilingual Web pages of hotels, bilingual touristic brochures and business correspondence.
    The target language of our experiments is English.
    We compare the three described methods to generate bilingual word classes.
    The classes MONO are determined by monolingually optimizing source and target language classes with Eq.
    (4).
    The classes BIL are determined by bilingually optimizing classes with Eq.
    (10).
    The classes BIL-2 are determined by first optimizing mono-lingually classes for the target language (English) and afterwards optimizing classes for the source language (Eq.
    (11) and Eq.
    (12)).
    For EuTRANs-I we used 60 classes and for EuTRANs-II we used 500 classes.
    We chose the number of classes in such a way that the final performance of the translation system was optimal.
