the optimal range.
    On the first iteration, we set the bounds on the search space, /3 min and B., very wide and see where the signal goes.
    The search will consider matching any byte x in the source file with some byte in the target file between f(x) &#8212; and f(x) + B., where f(x) is the current best estimate of the position in the target file that corresponds to position x in the source file.
    On subsequent iterations, the bounds are reduced as the algorithm obtains tighter estimates on the dynamic range of the signal.
    The memory that was saved by shrinking the bounds in this way can now be used to enhance the horizontal resolution.
    We keep iterating in this fashion as long as it is possible to improve the resolution by tightening the bounds on the signal.
    We need to allocate an array to hold the dots.
    Ideally, we would like to have enough memory so that no two points in the search space corresponded to the same cell in the array.
    That is, we would like to allocate the dotplot
