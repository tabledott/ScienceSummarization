 is significant at the 5% level; thus we can conclude that if the simplex verb has high recall retrieval of the phrasal verb?s co-occurrences, then the phrasal is likely to be compositional.
			The correlation score using the precision measure is negative since we would not expect the simplex verb to be a hyponym of the phrasal verb and thus, ifthe simplex verb does have high precision re trieval of the phrasal verb?s co-occurrences, it is less likely to be compositional.
			Finally, we obtained a very similar result (0.217) by ranking phrasals according to their inverse relative frequency with their simplex constituent (i.e., freq(simplex)freq(phrasal) ).
			Thus, it would seem that the three-way connection betweendistributional generality, hyponymy and rela tive frequency exists for verbs as well as nouns.
	
	
			We have presented an analysis of a set of dis tributional similarity measures.
			We have seen that there is a large amount of variation in the neighbours selected by different measures andtherefor
