ees with different depths are calculated and their arithmetic mean is computed as the syntax tree based metric, which we denote as &#8220;subtree metric&#8221; STM: where D is the maximum depth of subtrees considered, count(t) denotes the number of times subtree t appears in the candidate&#8217;s syntax tree, and countclip(t) denotes the clipped number of times t appears in the references&#8217; syntax trees.
    Clipped here means that, for a given subtree, the count computed from the hypothesis syntax tree can not exceed the maximum number of times the subtree occurs in any single reference&#8217;s syntax tree.
    A simple example with one hypothesis and one reference is shown in Figure 2.
    Setting the maximum depth to 3, we go through the hypothesis syntax tree and compute the fraction of subtrees with different depths.
    For the 1-depth subtrees, we get S, NP, VP, PRON, V, NP which also appear in the reference syntax tree.
    Since PRON only occurs once in the reference, its clipped count should be
