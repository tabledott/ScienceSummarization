, the ones used in sentences 1-4 are correct because they exist.
    Expressions such as these are called collocations.
    Collocations vary tremendously in the number of words involved, in the syntactic categories of the words, in the syntactic relations between the words, and in how rigidly the individual words are used together.
    For example, in some cases, the words of a collocation must be adjacent, as in sentences 1-5 above, while in others they can be separated by a varying number of other words.
    Unfortunately, with few exceptions (e.g., Benson, Benson, and Ilson 1986a) collocations are generally unavailable in compiled form.
    This creates a problem for persons not familiar with the sublanguagel as well as for several machine applications such as language generation.
    In this paper we describe a set of techniques for automatically retrieving such collocations from naturally occurring textual corpora.
    These techniques are based on statistical methods; they have been implemented in a to
