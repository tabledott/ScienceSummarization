method of Miyao, Ninomiya, and Tsujii (2005).
    In this method, we convert the Penn Treebank into an HPSG treebank, and collect HPSG lexical entries from terminal nodes of the HPSG treebank.
    Figure 22 illustrates the process of treebank conversion and lexicon collection.
    We first convert and fertilize parse trees of the Penn Treebank.
    This step identifies syntactic constructions that require special treatment in HPSG, such as raising/control and long-distance dependencies.
    These constructions are then annotated with typed feature structures so that they conform to the HPSG analysis.
    Next, we apply HPSG schemas and principles, and obtain fully specified HPSG parse trees.
    This step solves feature structure constraints given in the previous step, and fills unspecified constraints.
    Failures of schema/principle applications indicate that the annotated constraints do not Extracting HPSG lexical entries from the Penn Treebank. conform to the HPSG analysis, and require revisions.
