it has been shown that the coverage of the paraphrase patterns is not high enough, especially when the used paraphrase patterns are long or complicated (Quirk et al., 2004).
    Thesaurus-based methods: The thesaurus-based methods generate a paraphrase t for a source sentence s by substituting some words in s with their synonyms (Bolshakov and Gelbukh, 2004; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006).
    This kind of method usually involves two phases, i.e., candidate extraction and paraphrase validation.
    In the first phase, it extracts all synonyms from a thesaurus, such as WordNet, for the words to be substituted.
    In the second phase, it selects an optimal substitute for each given word from the synonyms according to the context in s. This kind of method is simple, since the thesaurus synonyms are easy to access.
    However, it cannot generate other types of paraphrases but only synonym substitution.
    NLG-based methods: NLG-based methods (Kozlowski et al., 2003; Power and Scott, 2005) generally involve two st
