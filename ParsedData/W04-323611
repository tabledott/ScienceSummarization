BO, the open category of the CTB corpus, where participants were free to use any available resources and were not restricted to only the official released training data of CTB.
    On this CTBO task, we used as additional training data the AS training corpus provided by SIGHAN, after converting the AS training corpus to GB encoding.
    We found that with this additional AS training data added to the original 3 Last ranked participant of SIGHAN CTB (closed) with F-measure 73.2% is not shown in Figure 2 due to space constraint. official released CTB training data of SIGHAN, our word segmenter achieved an F-measure of 92.2%, higher than the best reported F-measure in the CTB open task.
    With sufficient training data, our word segmenter can perform very well.
    In our evaluation, we also found that the additional features we introduced in Section 2.2 and the post-processing step consistently improved average word segmentation F-measure, when evaluated on the 4 SIGHAN test corpora in the closed track.
