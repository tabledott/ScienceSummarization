ting the possibility of robust, yet feasible, disambiguation.
    In this section we identify and analyze basic aspects of a statistical sense disambiguation method and compare several proposed corpus of moderate size can be valuable when constructing a bilingual lexicon, thus justifying the effort of maintaining such a corpus. methods (including ours) along these aspects.'
    This analysis may be useful for future research on sense disambiguation, as well as for the development of sense disambiguation modules in practical systems.
    The basic aspects that will be reviewed are The first three aspects deal with the components of a disambiguation method, as would be implemented for a practical application.
    The fourth is a methodological issue, which is relevant for developing, testing, and comparing disambiguation methods.
    We identify three major types of information that were used in statistical methods for sense disambiguation: The first type of information is the one used in the current paper, in
