the other.
    The F-Measure is .50 and the Whole Frame Accuracy is 0%.
    As we mentioned before, we label and evaluate the semantic frame of every predicate in the sentence separately.
    It is possible for a sentence to contain several propositions&#8212;annotations of predicates occurring in the sentence.
    For example, in the sentence The spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore Jupiter, there are two propositions, for the verbs faces and explore.
    These are: [The spacecraft]ARG0 [faces]PRED [a six-year journey to explore Jupiter]ARG1.
    [The spacecraft]ARG0 faces a six-year journey to [explore]PRED [Jupiter]ARG1.
    Our evaluation measures compare the guessed and correct set of labeled spans for each proposition.
    The CoNLL evaluation measure (Carreras and M`arquez 2004, 2005) is almost the same as our argument-based measure.
    The only difference is that the CoNLL measure introduces an additional label type for arguments, of the form R-ARGX, used for referring exToutanova, Haghighi
