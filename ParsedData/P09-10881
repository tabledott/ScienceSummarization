 2003).
    Although very few researchers use word-based models for translation per se, such models are still widely used in the training of phrase-based models.
    These wordbased models are used to find the latent wordalignments between bilingual sentence pairs, from which a weighted string transducer can be induced (either finite state (Koehn et al., 2003) or synchronous context free grammar (Chiang, 2007)).
    Although wide-spread, the disconnect between the translation model and the alignment model is artificial and clearly undesirable.
    Word-based models are incapable of learning translational equivalences between non-compositional phrasal units, while the algorithms used for inducing weighted transducers from word-alignments are based on heuristics with little theoretical justification.
    A model which can fulfil both roles would address both the practical and theoretical short-comings of the machine translation pipeline.
    The machine translation literature is littered with various attempts t
