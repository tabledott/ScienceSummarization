ain a probability p(O  |e) that the target word e is aligned to O words.
    By including this probability, it is possible to explicitly describe the fact that for instance the German word &#168;ubermorgen produces four English words (the day after tomorrow).
    In particular, the fertility O = 0 is used for prepositions or articles that have no direct counterpart in the other language.
    To describe the fertility-based alignment models in more detail, we introduce, as an alternative alignment representation, the inverted alignments, which define a mapping from target to source positions rather than the other way around.
    We allow several positions in the source language to be covered; that is, we consider alignments B of the form An important constraint for the inverted alignment is that all positions of the source sentence must be covered exactly once; that is, the Bi have to form a partition of the set {1, ... , j, ... ,J}.
    The number of words Oi = |Bi |is the fertility of the word ei.
