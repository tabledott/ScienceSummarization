d to be 0.
    The right context similarity, simR(wi,w2,w), is defined equivalently, for /(wi , w) and /(w2, w)4.
    Using definition 4 for each word w in the lexicon, we get 2 &#8226; 1 similarity values for w1 and w2, where 1 is the size of the lexicon.
    The general similarity between w1 and w2, termed sim(wi , w2), is defined as a weighted average of these 2 &#8226; 1 values.
    It is necessary to use some weighting mechanism, since small values of mutual information tend to be less significant and more vulnerable to noisy data.
    We found that the maximal value involved in computing the similarity relative to a specific word provides a useful weight for this word in computing the average.
    Thus, the weight for a specific left context similarity value, WL(wi, w2, w), is defined as: WL(wi, w2, w) = max(i(w, wi), /(w, w2)) (5) (notice that this is the same as the denominator in definition 4).
    This definition provides intuitively appropriate weights, since we would like to give more weight to co
