 with word_align's output.
    Table 2 summarizes the results of the second experiment.
    The figures indicate the expected relative frequency of each offset from the correct alignment.
    This relative frequency was computed according to the word frequencies in the stratified sample.
    As shown in the table, for 60.5% of the tokens the alignment is accurate, and in 84% the offset from the correct alingment is at most 3.
    These figures demonstrate the usefulness of word_align for constructing bilingual lexicons, and its impact on 'As explained earlier, word_align produces a partial alignment.
    For the purpose of the evaluation, we used linear interpolation to get alignments for all the positions in the sample.
    6Recall that the window size we used is 20 words in each direction, which means that word_align cannot recover from larger errors in char_align. char align errors (in words) Figure 3: Word_align reduces the variance (average square error) by a factor of 5 over char_align alone (notice the
