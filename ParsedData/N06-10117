glish-Arabic and English-Korean generative transliteration models, respectively.
    (Knight and Graehl, 1997) build a generative model for backward transliteration from Japanese to English.
    While generative models are often robust, they tend to make independence assumptions that do not hold in data.
    The discriminative learning framework argued for in (Roth, 1998; Roth, 1999) as an alternative to generative models is now used widely in NLP, even in the context of word alignment (Taskar et al., 2005; Moore, 2005).
    We make use of it here too, to learn a discriminative transliteration model that requires little knowledge of the target language.
  
  
    In essence, the algorithm we present uses temporal alignment as a supervision signal to iteratively train a discriminative transliteration model, which can be viewed as a distance metric between and English NE and a potential transliteration.
    On each iteration, it selects a set of transliteration candidates for each NE according to the current mo
