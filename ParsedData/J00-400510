    In (2a) and (2b), for example, the predicative NP the/a president of DD cannot be replaced by the proper name Higgins without changing the meaning of the sentence beyond recognition, indicating that the relation between the two NPs must be something other than coreference: We will have more to say about predicative NPs in the next section.
    To sum up, MUC's annotators have been instructed to let NPs of all major classes (definite, quantificational, and indefinite) &amp;quot;corefer&amp;quot; liberally with other NPs, even when it is far from clear that the NPs in question have been used referentially.

    The TD admits that certain instruc
