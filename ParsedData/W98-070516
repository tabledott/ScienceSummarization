 in the WordNet hierarchy, among other issues.
    A second goal is to apply synset indexing in a Cross-Language environment, using the Euro WordNet multilingual database (Gonzalo et al., In press).
    Indexing by synsets offers a neat way of performing language-independent retrieval, by mapping synsets into the EuroWordNet InterLingual Index that links monolingual wordnets for all the languages covered by EuroWordNet.
