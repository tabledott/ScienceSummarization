cific senses of a word will need to isolate samples of those senses.
  While this process has been partially automated, it appears to require substantial human intervention to handle an unrestricted vocabulary.
  Conclusion This paper has described an approach to word sense disambiguation using statistical models of word classes.
  This method overcomes the knowledge acquisition bottleneck faced by word-specific sense discriminators.

  1992 resolution in training material acquisition, the system has acquired an extensive set of sense discriminators from unrestricted monolingnal texts withoat haman intervention.
  Class models also offer the additional advantages of smaller model storage requirements and increased implementation efficiency due to reduced dimensionality.
  Also, they can correctly identify a word sense which occurs rarely or only once in the corpus - - p
