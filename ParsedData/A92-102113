  In the rule-based tagger, contextual information is captured in fewer than eighty rules.
    This makes for a much more perspicuous tagger, aiding in better understanding and simplifying further development of the tagger.
    Contextual information is expressed in a much more compact and understandable form.
    As can be seen from comparing error rates, this compact representation of contextual information is just as effective as the information hidden in the large tables of contextual probabilities.
    Perhaps the biggest contribution of this work is in demonstrating that the stochastic method is not the only viable approach for part of speech tagging.
    The fact that the simple rule-based tagger can perform so well should offer encouragement for researchers to further explore rule-based tagging, searching for a better and more expressive set of patch templates and other variations on this simple but effective theme.
