so constrains the word's usage in the language (Lyons, 1977), due to its evaluative characteristics (Battistella, 1990).
    For example, some nearly synonymous words differ in orientation because one implies desirability and the other does not (e.g., simple versus simplistic).
    In linguistic constructs such as conjunctions, which impose constraints on the semantic orientation of their arguments (Anscombre and Ducrot, 1983; Elhadad and McKeown, 1990), the choices of arguments and connective are mutually constrained, as illustrated by: The tax proposal was { simple and well-received simplistic but well-received *simplistic and well-received by the public.
    In addition, almost all antonyms have different semantic orientations.'
    If we know that two words relate to the same property (for example, members of the same scalar group such as hot and cold) but have different orientations, we can usually infer that they are antonyms.
    Given that semantically similar words can be identified automatically on
