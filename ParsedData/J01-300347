 are on test data that was never seen in training.'
    The first training and testing methodology we follow is 10-fold cross-validation.
    In this approach, the system randomly divides the data into ten parts, and runs ten times on a different 90%-training-data/10%-test-data split, yielding an average accuracy and standard error across the ten test sets.
    This training methodology is very useful for 7 One anonymous reviewer raised the concern that we do not test on verbs that were unseen by the authors prior to finalizing the specific features to count.
    However, this does not reduce the generality of our results.
    The features we use are motivated by linguistic theory, and derived from the set of thematic properties that discriminate the verb classes.
    It is therefore very unlikely that they are skewed to the particular verbs we have chosen.
    Furthermore, our cross-validation experiments, described in the next subsection, show that our results hold across a very large number of randomly sel
