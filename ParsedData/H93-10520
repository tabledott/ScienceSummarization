  In this paper we show that for certain definitions of collocation, a polysemous word exhibits essentially only one sense per collocation.
  We test his empirical hypothesis for several definitions of sense and collocation, and discover that it holds with 90-99% accuracy for binary ambiguities.
  We utilize this property in a disambiguation algorithm that achieves precision of 92% using combined models of very local context.
  INTRODUCTION The use of collocations to resolve lexical ambiguities i cer- tainly not a new idea.
  The first approaches to sense dis- ambiguation, such as [Kelly and Stone 1975], were based on simple hand-built decision tables consisting almost ex- clusively of question
