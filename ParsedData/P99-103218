    Finally, a feature is included representing co-occurrence of word tokens and punctuation marks with the subjective and objective classification.4 There are many other features to investigate in future work, such as features based on tags assigned to previous utterances (see, e.g., (Wiebe et al., 1997; Samuel et al., 1998)), and features based on semantic classes, such as positive and negative polarity adjectives (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and reporting verbs (Bergler, 1992).
    The data consists of the concatenation of the two corpora annotated with bias-corrected tags as described above.
    The baseline accuracy, i.e., the frequency of the more frequent class, is only 51%.
    The results of the experiments are very pro
