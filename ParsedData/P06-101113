agments.
    The lower part of the figure shows the source and target sentence together with their alignment.
    Above are displayed the initial signal and the filtered signal.
    The circles indicate which fragments of the target sentence are selected by the procedure. translated; for this, we employ the distribution.
    Thus, for each non-linked target word , we look for the source word least likely to be its nontranslation: .
    If exists, we set the signal value for to ; otherwise, we set it to .
    This is the initial signal.
    We obtain the filtered signal by applying an averaging filter, which sets the value at each point to be the average of several values surrounding it.
    In our experiments, we use the surrounding 5 values, which produced good results on a development set.
    We then simply retain the &#8220;positive fragments&#8221; of , i.e. those fragments for which the corresponding filtered signal values are positive.
    However, this approach will often produce short &#8220;positive
