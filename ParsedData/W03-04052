 biographical summaries from corpora (Schiffman et al., 2001).
    Along with disambiguation, our system simultaneously collects biographic information (Table 1).
    The relevant biographical attributes are depicted along with a clustering which shows the distinct referents (Section 4.1).
  
  
    Past work on this task (e.g.
    Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) has primarily approached personal name disambiguation using document context profiles or vectors, which recognize and distinguish identical name instances based on partially indicative words in context such as computer or car in the Clark case.
    However, in the specialized case of personal names, there is more precise information available.
    In particular, information extraction techniques can add high precision, categorical information such as approximate age/date-of-birth, nationality and occupation.
    This categorical data can support or exclude a candidate nameHreferent matches with higher confidence and greater pinpoint accuracy than via simple
