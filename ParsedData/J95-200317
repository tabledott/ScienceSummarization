 same sentence uttered in different discourse situations may have different centers.
    Centers are thus discourse constructs.
    Furthermore, centers are semantic objects, not words, phrases, or syntactic forms.
    Each utterance U in a discourse segment (DS) is assigned a set of forward-looking centers, Cf(U, DS); each utterance other than the segment initial utterance is assigned a single backward-looking center, Cb (U, DS).
    To simplify notation, when the relevant discourse segment is clear, we will drop the associated DS and use Cb (U) and Cf (U).
    The backward-looking center of utterance Un+1 connects with one of the forwardlooking centers of utterance U.
    The connection between the backward-looking center of utterance Un+i and the forward-looking centers of utterance Un may be of several types.
    To describe these types, we need to introduce two new relations, realizes and directly realizes, that relate centers to linguistic expressions.
    We will say that U directly realizes c if U is
