be possible to correct for this situation by comparing the hypernyms for the two clusters and if there is little overlap, deleting their parent node and attaching them to their grandparent instead.
    It would be useful to try to identify terms made up of multiple words, rather than just using the head nouns of the noun phrases.
    Not only would this provide a more Useful hierarchy, or at least perhaps one that is more useful for certain applications, but it would also help to prevent some errors.
    Hearst (1992) gives an example of a potential hyponym-hypernym pair &amp;quot;broken bone/injury&amp;quot; .
    Using our algorithm, we would learn that &amp;quot;injury&amp;quot; is a hypernym of &amp;quot;bone&amp;quot;.
    Ideally, this would not appear in our hierarchy since a more common hypernym would be chosen instead, but it is possible that in some cases a bad hypernym would be found based on multiple word phrases.
