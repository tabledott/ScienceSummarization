ence becomes long.
    Instead, we build a packed data structure, called a constraint network, that contains all the syntactic structures implicitly.
    Explicit parse trees can be generated whenever necessary, but it may take a more than exponential computation time.
    Figure 5 shows the initial constraint network for sentence (5).
    A node in a constraint network corresponds to a role.
    Since each word has only one role governor in the grammar G2, the constraint network has five nodes corresponding to the five words in the sentence.
    In the figure, the node labeled V1 represents the governor role of the word Vi , and so on.
    A node is associated with a set of possible values that the role can take as its value, called a domain.
    The domains of the initial constraint network are computed by examining unary constraints ((G2a-1) to (G2a-5) in our example).
    For example, the modifiee of the role of the word V1 must be ROOT and its label must be nil according to the unary constraint (G2a5), a
