cal and partitional.
			In hierarchical agglomerative algorithms, clusters are constructed by iteratively merging the most similar clusters.
			These algorithms differ in how they compute cluster similarity.
			In single-link clustering, the similarity between two clusters is the similarity between their most similar members while complete-link clustering uses the similarity between their least similar members.
			Average-link clustering computes this similarity as the average similarity between all pairs of elements across clusters.
			The complexity of these algorithms is O(n2logn), where n is the number of elements to be clustered (Jain, Murty, Flynn 1999).
			Chameleon is a hierarchical algorithm that employs dynamic modeling to improve clustering quality (Karypis, Han, Kumar 1999).
			When merging two clusters, one might consider the sum of the similarities between pairs of elements across the clusters (e.g. average-link clustering).
			A drawback of this approach is that the existence of a single pair o
