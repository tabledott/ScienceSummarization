 96% precision (148/154) and 50% recall (148/298).
    Adding in rules 5 and 6 resolves a total of 190 pronouns correctly, with only 16 mistakes, a precision of 92% and recall of 64%.
    This contrasts strongly with the resolve-all-pronouns results of 78%.
    The last two rules, 7 and 8 performed quite badly on the test data.
    Despite their poor performance, CogNIAC still remained comparable to the Naive Algorithm.
    3.2.2 Experiment 2-- All pronouns in MUC-6 evaluation: CogNIAC was used as the pronoun component in the University Pennsylvania's coreference entry5 in the MUC-6 evaluation.
    Pronominal anaphora constitutes 17% of coreference annotations in the evaluation data used.
    The remaining instances of anaphora included common noun anaphora and coreferent instances of proper nouns.
    As a result being part of a larger system, changes were made to CogNIAC to make it fit in better with the other components of the overall system in addition to adding rules that were specialized for the new kin
