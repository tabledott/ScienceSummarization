s of the low consistency by way of comparison with the LOB data set, which is known to be very consistent.
    We have taken one-tenth of the test sets of both WSJ and LOB and manually examined each token where the WPDV(Tags+Context) tagging differs from the benchmark tagging.
    The first indication that consistency is a major factor in performance is found in the basic correctness information, given in Table 10.
    For WSJ, there is a much higher percentage where the difference in tagging is due to an erroneous tag in the benchmark.
    This does not mean, however, that the tagger should be given a higher accuracy score, as it may well be that the part of the benchmark where tagger and benchmark do agree contains a similar percentage of benchmark errors.
    It does imply, though, that the WSJ tagging contains many more errors than the LOB tagging, which is likely to be detrimental to the derivation of automatic taggers.
    The cases where the tagger is found to be wrong provide interesting information a
