first fst might accept the pair (ab, c) by the transition sequence a: c b:c, while the other accepts that same pair with the sequence a: c b: c. This string-pair belongs to the intersection of the relations, but unless there is some other accepting path common to both machines, it will not belong to Rel(P).
    Indeed, when we apply this construction to fsts accepting the relations we used to derive the context-free language above, we find that Rel(P) is the empty relation (with no string-pairs at all) instead of the set-theoretic intersection R1 n R2However, if R1 and R2 are accepted by transducers none of whose accepting paths have &amp;containing labels, then a string-pair belonging to both relations will be accepted by identically labeled paths in both transducers.
    The language Paths(Ti) n Paths(T2) will contain a path-string corresponding to that pair, that pair will belong to Rel(P), and Rel(P) will be exactly R1 n R2.
    Thus, we complete the proof that the same-length relations are closed under i
