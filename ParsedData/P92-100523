 can be contrasted with Logical Form as it is normally understood, which represents the results of carrying out a semantic derivation.
    The difference between specifying a derivation and carrying it out is what makes resolution order independent in monotonic interpretation.
    Making a resolution to QLF only specifies when and how an expression should be evaluated during semantic derivation; it does not carry out that part of the derivation.
    Where no distinction is drawn between making a resolution and carrying out the corresponding step of the derivation, the order of resolution can be important.
    Thus, for Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira (1991), where this distinction is not drawn, the precise interleaving of scope and ellipsis resolution determines the interpretation of the sentence.
    In QLF, resolutions dictate the order in which various steps of the derivation are carried out, but the resolution order does not reflect the derivation order.
