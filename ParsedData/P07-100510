ortion -y and a corresponding English portion &#945;, where each portion is a sequence of words and non-terminal symbols.
    Our WSD classifier suggests a list of English phrases (where each phrase consists of one or more English words) with associated contextual probabilities as possible translations for each particular Chinese phrase.
    In general, the Chinese phrase may consist of k Chinese words, where k = 1, 2, 3, ....
    However, we limit k to 1 or 2 for experiments reported in this paper.
    Future work can explore enlarging k. Whenever Hiero is about to extract a grammar rule where its Chinese portion is a phrase of one or two Chinese words with no non-terminal symbols, we note the location (sentence and token offset) in the Chinese half of the parallel corpus from which the Chinese portion of the rule is extracted.
    The actual sentence in the corpus containing the Chinese phrase, and the one sentence before and the one sentence after that actual sentence, will serve as the context for one tra
