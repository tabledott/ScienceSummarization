t can cross at most one bar- rier without leaving an intermedia~te trace.
			An attribute named ~hbarr?0r is used to imple- ment this l)rinciple.
			A message containing the attribute value -whbarrier iS used to rep- resent an X-bar structure contMnlng a posi- tion out ol7 which a wh-constituent has moved, but without yet crossing a barrier.
			The wdue +whbarrier means that the movement has M- ready crossed one barrier.
			Certain dominance links in the network are designated as bar- rier links.
			Bounding condition is implemented by tile percolation constraints attached to the barrier links, which block any message with +whbarrier and change -whbarrior to +whbarrier before the message is allowed to pass through.

			'\]'he implementation of case theory in PI{,INCII~AII, is based on the following attribute vaJues: ca, govern, cm.
