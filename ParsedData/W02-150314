    The f-structures for the verbs in (11) are as in A final example comes from English progressives, as in (13).
    In order to distinguish these two forms, the English grammar uses a PROG feature within the tense/aspect system.
    (13b) shows the fstructure for (13a.ii).
    However, this distinction is not found in the other languages.
    For example, (14a) is used to express both (13a.i) and (13a.ii) in German.
