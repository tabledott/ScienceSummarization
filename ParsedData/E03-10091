imary linguistic data can account for first language acquisition by infant children (Finch and Chater, 1992a; Finch and Chater, 1992b; Redington et al., 1998).
    At this early phase of learning, only limited sources of information can be used: primarily distributional evidence, about the contexts in which words occur, and morphological evidence, (more strictly phonotactic or orthotactic evidence) about the sequence of symbols (letters or phonemes) of which each word is formed.
    A number of different approaches have been presented for this task using exclusively distributional evidence to cluster the words together, starting with (Lamb, 1961) and these have been shown to produce good results in English, Japanese and Chinese.
    These languages have however rather simple morphology and thus words will tend to have higher frequency than in more morphologically complex languages.
    In this paper we will address two issues: first, whether the existing algorithms work adequately on a range of languages and
