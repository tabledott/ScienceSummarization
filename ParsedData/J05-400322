l as training examples.
    We therefore use for training only those pairs from the Cartesian product that are accepted by the word-overlap filter.
    This has the additional advantage that, since all these pairs have many words in common, the classifier learns to make distinctions that cannot be made based on word overlap alone.
    To summarize, we prepare our classifier training set in the following manner: starting from a parallel corpus of about 5,000 sentence pairs, we generate all the sentence pairs in the Cartesian product; we discard the pairs that do not fulfill the conditions of the word-overlap filter; if the resulting set is imbalanced, i.e., the ratio of non-parallel to parallel pairs is greater than five, we balance it by removing randomly chosen nonparallel pairs.
    We then compute word alignments and extract feature values.
    Using the training set, we compute values for the classifier feature weights using the YASMET4 implementation of the GIS algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff 1974).
