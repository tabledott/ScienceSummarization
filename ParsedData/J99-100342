    The results in Table 3 were obtained using a version of SIMR that included all the enhancements described in Section 4.6.
    It is interesting to consider the degree to which each enhancement improves performance.
    I remapped the French/English bitexts listed in Table 3 with two stripped-down versions of SIMR.
    One version was basic SIMR without any enhancements.
    The other version incorporated overlapping chains, but performed only one search pass.
    The deterioration in performance varied widely.
    For example, on the parliamentary debates bitext, the RMS error rose from 5.7 to 16 when only one search pass was allowed, but rose only another 2 points to 18 using non-overlapping chains.
    In contrast, on the U.N. annual report bitext, the extra search passes made no difference at all but non-overlapping chains increased the RMS error from 12 to 40.
    For most of the other bitexts, each enhancement reduced the RMS error by a few characters, compared to the basic version.
    However, the
