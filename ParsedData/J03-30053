ssim, and Modjeska (2003) use the Web for the resolution of nominal anaphora, and Zhu and Rosenfeld (2001) use Web-based n-gram counts to improve language modeling.
    A particularly interesting application is proposed by Grefenstette (1998), who uses the Web for example-based machine translation.
    His task is to translate compounds from French into English, with corpus evidence serving as a filter for candidate translations.
    An example is the French compound groupe de travail.
    There are five translations of groupe and three translations for travail (in the dictionary that Grefenstette [1998] is using), resulting in 15 possible candidate translations.
    Only one of them, namely, work group, has a high corpus frequency, which makes it likely that this is the correct translation into English.
    Grefenstette (1998) observes that this approach suffers from an acute data sparseness problem if the counts are obtained from a conventional corpus.
    However, as Grefenstette (1998) demonstrates, this
