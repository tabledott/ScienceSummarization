    The task therefore necessarily involves two steps: (1) the determination of all the different senses for every word relevant (at least) to the text or discourse under consideration; and (2) a means to assign each occurrence of a word to the appropriate sense.
    Much recent work on WSD relies on predefined senses for step (1), including: The precise definition of a sense is, however, a matter of considerable debate within the community.
    The variety of approaches to defining senses has raised concern about the comparability of much WSD work, and given the difficulty of the problem of sense definition, no definitive solution is likely to be found soon (see Section 3.2).
    However, since the earliest days of WSD work, there has been general agreement that the problems of morpho-syntactic disambiguation and sense disambiguation can be disentangled (see, e.g., Kelly and Stone [19751).
