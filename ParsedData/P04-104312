ng &#57738; in two steps: (1) from the semantic structure space Y (i.e.
    PAF or SCF objects) to the set of all their possible sub-structures element in Fp,a with an abuse of notation we use it to indicate the objects themselves. where nc(nx) is the number of the children of nx and ch(n, i) is the i-th child of the node n. Note that as the productions are the same ch(nx, i) = ch(nz, i).
    This kind of kernel has the drawback of assigning more weight to larger structures while the argument type does not strictly depend on the size of the argument (Moschitti and Bejan, 2004).
    To overcome this problem we can scale the relative importance of the tree fragments using a parameter A for the cases (2) and (3), i.e.
    A(nx, nz) = A and respectively.
    It is worth noting that even if the above equations define a kernel function similar to the one proposed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002), the substructures on which it operates are different from the parse-tree kernel.
    For example, Figure 4 shows that struct
