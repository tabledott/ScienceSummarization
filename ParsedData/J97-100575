his, we turned to machine learning to automatically develop algorithms from large numbers of both training examples and features.
    We use the machine learning program C4.5 (Quinlan 1993) to automatically develop segmentation algorithms from our corpus of coded narratives, where each potential boundary site has been classified and represented as a set of linguistic features.
    The first input to C4.5 specifies the names of the classes to be learned (boundary and nonboundary), and the names and potential values of a fixed set of coding features (Figure 6).
    The second input is the training data, i.e., a set of examples for which the class and feature values (as in Figure 7) are specified.
    Our training set of 10 narratives provides 1004 examples of potential boundary sites.
    The output of C4.5 is a classification algorithm expressed as a decision tree, which predicts the class of a potential boundary given its set of feature values.
    Because machine learning makes it convenient to induce decisi
