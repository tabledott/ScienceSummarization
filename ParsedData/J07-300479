r alternative formalisms from straightforward to less straightforward for this approach.
    We would also expect that dependency grammars Mel&#8217;&#711;cuk and Pertsov 1987; Hudson 1984) and parsers (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005) could be trained and tested with little extra work on the dependencies in CCGbank.
    Finally, we believe that existing methods for translating the Penn Treebank from scratch into other grammar formalisms will benefit from including preprocessing similar to that described here.
    As some indication of the relative ease with which these techniques transfer, we offer the observation that the 900K-word German Tiger dependency corpus has recently been translated into CCG using very similar techniques by Hockenmaier (2006), and C&#184; ak&#305;c&#305; (2005) has derived a Turkish lexicon from the a similarly preprocessed version of the METU-Sabanc&#184;&#305; Turkish dependency treebank (Oflazer et al. 2003).
    A fundamental assumption behind attempts at the automatic trans
