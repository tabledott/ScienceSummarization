tion values from Section 3.
			The test set is constructed by intersecting the words in WordNet with the nouns in the corpus whose total mutual information with all of its contexts exceeds a threshold m. Since WordNet has a low coverage of proper names, we removed all capitalized nouns.
			We constructed two test sets: S13403 consisting of 13403 words (m = 250) and S3566 consisting of 3566 words (m = 3500).
			We then removed from the answer classes the words that did not occur in the test sets.
			Table 1 summa rizes the test sets.
			The sizes of the WordNet classes vary a lot.
			For S13403 there are 99 classes that contain three words or less and the largest class contains 3246 words.
			For S3566, 78 classes have three or less words and the largest class contains 1181 words.

			Cluster Evaluation.
			We clustered the test sets using CBC and the clustering algorithms of Section 2 and applied the evaluation methodology from the previous secti
