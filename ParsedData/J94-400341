ctical translation system: In addition, each of the remaining target alternatives for each source word was evaluated as to whether it is a suitable translation in the current context.
    This evaluation was later used to judge the selections of the algorithm.
    If all the alternatives were considered suitable, then the source word was eliminated from the test set, since any decision for it would have been considered successful.
    We ended up with 103 Hebrew and 54 German ambiguous words.
    For each Hebrew word we had an average of 3.27 alternative translations and an average of 1.44 correct translations.
    The average number of translations of a German word was 3.26, and there were 1.33 correct translations.
    Since we did not have a Hebrew parser, we have simulated the two steps of determining the source syntactic tuples and mapping them to English by reversing the order of these steps, in the following way: First, the sample sentences were translated manually, as literally as possible, into Engli
