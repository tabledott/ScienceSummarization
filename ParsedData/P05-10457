ximal outcome, having the effect that the Markov chain always climbs uphill.
    Thus if we gradually decrease c from 1 to 0, the Markov chain increasingly tends to go uphill.
    This annealing technique has been shown to be an effective technique for stochastic optimization (Laarhoven and Arts, 1987).
    To verify the effectiveness of Gibbs sampling and simulated annealing as an inference technique for hidden state sequence models, we compare Gibbs and Viterbi inference methods for a basic CRF, without the addition of any non-local model.
    The results, given in Table 1, show that if the Gibbs sampler is run long enough, its accuracy is the same as a Viterbi decoder.
  
  
    Our basic CRF model follows that of Lafferty et al. (2001).
    We choose a CRF because it represents the state of the art in sequence modeling, allowing both discriminative training and the bi-directional flow of probabilistic information across the sequence.
    A CRF is a conditional sequence model which represents the probabili
