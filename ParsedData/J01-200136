rocedure builds in a bottom-up fashion, looking for larger and larger chunks that are worth (in an MDL sense) assigning the status of dictionary entries.
    Thus, if we look at unbroken orthographic texts in English, the two-letter combination th will become the first candidate chosen for lexical status; later, is will achieve that status too, and soon this will as well.
    The entry this will not, in effect, point to its four letters directly, but will rather point to the chunks th and is, which still retain their status in the lexicon (for their robust integrity is supported by their appearance throughout the lexicon).
    The creation of larger constituents will occasionally lead to the elimination of smaller chunks, but only when the smaller chunk appears almost always in a single larger unit.
    An example of an analysis provided by de Marcken's algorithm is given in (1), taken from de Marcken (1995), in which I have indicated the smallest-level constituent by placing letters immediately next to one a
