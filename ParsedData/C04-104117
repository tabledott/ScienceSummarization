an, 2003) and, as the table shows, results in very large charts.Note that, even with this relaxed setting on the su pertagger, the number of categories assigned to each word is only around 3 on average.
			This suggests that it is only through use of the supertagger that we are able to estimate a log-linear parsing model on all of the training data at all, since without it the memory 3The figures in the table are estimates based on a sample of the nodes in the cluster.
			requirements would be far too great, even for the entire 64-node cluster.4 The second row shows the reduction in size if the parser is only allowed to combine categorieswhich have combined in the training data.
			This sig nificantly reduces the number of categories created using the composition rules, and also prevents thecreation of unlikely categories using rule combina tions not seen in CCGbank.
			The results show thatthe memory and disk usage are reduced by approx imately 25% using these constraints.
			The third row shows a further re
