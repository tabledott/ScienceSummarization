rithm 1.
    Thus we now have a simple method for extracting rules of PA(S, T) from the alignment graph: search the space of graph fragments for frontier graph fragments.
    Unfortunately, the search space of all fragments of a graph is exponential in the size of the graph, thus this procedure can also take a long time to execute.
    To arrive at a much faster procedure, we take advantage of the following provable facts: minimal frontier graph fragment rooted at n (observe that for any node n' not in the frontier set, there is no frontier graph fragment rooted at n', by definition).
    By minimal, we mean that the frontier graph fragment is a subgraph of every other frontier graph fragment with the same root.
    Clearly, for an alignment graph with k nodes, there are at most k minimal frontier graph fragments.
    In Figure 7, we show the seven minimal frontier graph fragments of the alignment graph of Figure 5.
    Furthermore, all other frontier graph fragments can be created by composing 2 or more mini
