  For this reason, the greatest score path can be searched for by using dynamic programming method.
    Calculation is performed column by column going left from a non-zero element in the lowest row in An to the leftmost column in A.
    For each element in a column, the best partial path reaching it is found by extending the partial paths from the previous column and choosing the greatest score path (the left part of Figure 5).
    In extending partial paths, elements' points and penalty points are given to paths step by step.
    Then, among the paths to the leftmost column, the path that has the greatest score becomes the best path from the starting non-zero element (the right part of Figure 5).
    Of all the best paths from all the non-zero lowest row elements, the path that has the greatest path score (the maximum path) is chosen as defining the scope of the CS; i.e., the series of bunsetsus on the left side of the maximum path (pre-conjunct) and the series of bunsetsus under it (post-conjunct) are conj
