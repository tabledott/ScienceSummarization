he lexicon is for domain-independent expressions, and thus we need more lexical entries to grasp the positive and negative aspects in a specific domain.
  
  
    This section introduces the intra- and intersentential contexts in which we assume context coherency for polarity, and describes some preliminary analysis of the assumption.
  
  
    The identification of propositions described in Section 3.1 clarifies our viewpoint of the contexts.
    Here we consider two types of contexts: intra-sentential context and intersentential context.
    Figure 2 illustrates the context coherency in a sample discourse (14), where the polarities are perfectly coherent.
