 input sentences.
    Thus the best way to test them is by using them for the ultimate goal: answering questions based on the input corpus.
    In this paper, we applied USP to extracting knowledge from biomedical abstracts and evaluated its performance in answering a set of questions that simulate the information needs of biomedical researchers.
    We used the GENIA dataset (Kim et al., 2003) as the source for knowledge extraction.
    It contains 1999 PubMed abstracts and marks all mentions of biomedical entities according to the GENIA ontology, such as cell, protein, and DNA.
    As a first approximation to the questions a biomedical researcher might ask, we generated a set of two thousand questions on relations between entities.
    Sample questions are: &#8220;What regulates MIP1alpha?&#8221;, &#8220;What does anti-STAT 1 inhibit?&#8221;.
    To simulate the real information need, we sample the relations from the 100 most frequently used verbs (excluding the auxiliary verbs be, have, and do), and sample
