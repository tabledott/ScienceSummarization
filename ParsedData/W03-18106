nd that different statistics are suited to different types of collocation - there is no easy route for collocation extraction.
    Moreover, they found that a simple co-occurrence frequency fares comparably, if not better, than most statistical tests of significance.
    Most people researching into multiwords assume some degree of non-compositionality.
    Blaheta and Johnson took human judgements on phrasality, opaqueness (a dichotomous scale) and a subjective judgement of relatedness (on a scale between 1 and 5).
    They showed that the opaqueness judgements correlated with the relatedness (good collocation) judgement.
    Also, those constructions judged to be phrasals tended to have higher ranks (higher opaqueness and relatedness) than prepositional verb particle constructions.
    Both Lin (1999) and Schone and Jurafsky (2001) have used distributional similarity to detect compositionality in multiwords.
    Schone and Jurafsky used measures on the vectors representing the multiword candidates compared
