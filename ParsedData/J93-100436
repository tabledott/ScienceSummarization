lly (from 36 to 50 for English&#8212;French and from 19 to 35 for English&#8212;German).
    The total errors were thereby increased from 55 to 85, or from 4.2% to 6.5%.
    We believe that characters are better because there are more of them, and therefore there is less uncertainty.
    On the average, there are 117 characters per sentence (including white space) and only 17 words per sentence.
    Recall that we have modeled variance as proportional to sentence length, V(I) --= s2/.
    Using the character data, we found previously that s2 6.5.
    The same argument applied to words yields s2 1.9.
    For comparison's sake, it is useful to consider the ratio of VV(m)/m (or equivalently, skirit), where m is the mean sentence length.
    We obtain ,VV(m)/m ratios of 0.22 for characters and 0.33 for words, indicating that characters are less noisy than words, and are therefore more suitable for use in align.
    Although Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) used lengths measured in words, comparisons of error rates b
