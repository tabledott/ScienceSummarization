ty is determined by the n-table.
    For simplicity, we split the n-table into two: a table for insert positions and a table for words to be inserted (Table 1).
    The node&#8217;s label and its parent&#8217;s label are used to index the table for insert positions.
    For example, the PRP node in Figure 1 has parent VB, thus . n&#8722;table t&#8722;table r&#8722;table parent=VBnode=PRP is the conditioning index.
    Using this label pair captures, for example, the regularity of inserting case-marker particles.
    When we decide which word to insert, no conditioning variable is used.
    That is, a function word like ga is just as likely to be inserted in one place as any other.
    In Figure 1, we inserted four words (ha, no, ga and desu) to create the third tree.
    The top VB node, two TO nodes, and the NN node inserted nothing.
    Therefore, the probability of obtaining the third tree given the second tree is 3.498e-9.
    Finally, we apply the translate operation to each leaf.
    We assume that this
