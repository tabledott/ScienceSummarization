    We assume standard implementations of 7 This version corrects the behavior of the previously published version in some boundary conditions.
    Thanks to D. Smith and J.
    May for pointing those cases out.
    In the actual implementation, an earlier version is used which has the correct behavior but not for cyclic forests (which the parser never produces).
    Function for computing the union of products of sorted lists (Huang and Chiang 2005).
    the priority queue subroutines HEAPIFY, INSERT, and EXTRACTBEST (Cormen et al. 2001).
    The k-best list generator is then easy to define (Figure 7).
    First, we generate a parse forest; then we simply apply MERGEPRODUCTS recursively to the whole forest, using memoization to ensure that we generate only one k-best list for each item in the forest.
    The pseudocode in Figure 7 will find only the weights for the k-best derivations; extending it to output the translations as well is a matter of modifying line 5 to package the English sides of rules toget
