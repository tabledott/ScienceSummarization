loping a statistical parser.
    A corollary of CCG&#8217;s base-generative treatment of long-range dependencies in relative clauses and coordinate constructions is that the standard predicate&#8211;argument relations can be derived via nonstandard surface derivations.
    The addition of &#8220;spurious&#8221; derivations in CCG complicates the modeling and parsing problems.
    In this article we consider two solutions.
    The first, following Hockenmaier (2003a), is to define a model in terms of normal-form derivations (Eisner 1996).
    In this approach we recover only one derivation leading to a given set of predicate&#8211;argument dependencies and ignore the rest.
    The second approach is to define a model over the predicate&#8211;argument dependencies themselves, by summing the probabilities of all derivations leading to a given set of dependencies.
    We also define a new efficient parsing algorithm for such a model, based on Goodman (1996), which maximizes the expected recall of dependencies.
