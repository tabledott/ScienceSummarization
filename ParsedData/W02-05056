ences to English sound sequences, renders this choice unattractive.
    Instead we propose a spelling-based model that maps directly into Arabic letter sequences, which can be trained on an English/Arabic name list as we describe in Section 5.
    But before we present any further details, we describe our evaluation data next.
  
  
    Our evaluation corpora consist of two data sets, a development test set and a blind one.
    The two sets consist of a list of person names extracted from Arabic newspaper articles.
    The development test set contains 854 names (377 unique names) and the blind test set contains 218 (85 unique names).
    The person names are then manually transliterated into English.
    The transliterations are then thoroughly reviewed and any obvious mistakes corrected.3 The corrected transliterations form the gold-standard we will compare our results with.
    We would like to investigate the suitability of the models proposed here for back- and forwardtransliteration.
    Therefore, each
