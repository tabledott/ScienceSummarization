    One final SHIFTn transition takes us to the terminal configuration cm = (&#955;cm, [ ], [ ], Ax).
    &#9632; Theorem 11 The worst-case time complexity of the projective, list-based algorithm is O(n2), where n is the length of the input sentence.
    The worst-case space complexity of the projective, list-based algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input sentence.
    Proof 12 Same as Proof 9.

    We have defined four different transition systems for incremental dependency parsing, proven their correctness for different classes of dependency graphs, and analyzed their time and space complexity under the assumption that there exists a constant-time oracle for predicting the next transition.
    In this section, we present an experimental evaluation of the accuracy and efficiency that can be achieved with these systems in deterministic data-driven parsing, that is, when the oracle is approximated by a classifier trained on treebank data.
    The purpose of the evaluation is
