    The first problem of interest is finding the highest weighted tree for a given input sentence x McDonald et al. (2005b) showed that this can be solved in O(n2) for unlabeled parsing using the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm for standard digraphs (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967).
    Unlike most exact projective parsing algorithms, which use efficient bottom-up chart parsing algorithms, the ChuLiu-Edmonds algorithm is greedy in nature.
    It begins by selecting the single best incoming dependency edge for each node j.
    It then post-processes the resulting graph to eliminate cycles and then continues recursively until a spanning tree (or valid dependency graph) results (see McDonald et al. (2005b) for details).
    The algorithm is trivially extended to the multidigraph case for use in labeled dependency parsing.
    First we note that if the maximum directed spanning tree of a multi-digraph Gx contains any edge (i, j)k, then we must have k = k* = argmaxk wkij.
    Otherwise we could simply substitute
