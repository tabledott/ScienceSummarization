icalized and fronted constituents closely related - see text Semantic Roles vocatives direction &amp; trajectory location manner purpose and reason temporal phrases Figure I: Functional Tags for our constituents - in other words, every bracket had just one label.
  The limitations of this became apparent when a word belonging to one syntactic ategory is used for another hnct ion or when it plays a role which we want to be able to identify easily.
  In the present scheme, each constituent has at least one label but as many as four tags, including numerical indices.
  We have adopted the set of functional tags shown in Figure 2 for use within the current annotation scheme.
  NPs and Ss which are clearly arguments of the verb are unmarked by any tag.
  We allow an open class of other cases that in- dividual annotators feel strongly should be part of the VP.
  These cases are tagged as -CLR (for CLosely Relatcd); they axe to be semantically analyzed as adjuncts.
  This class is an experiment in the current taggin
