with dashed boxes), and the transitions from T to B nodes are also forbidden.
    These nodes and transitions are ignored during the lattice construction processing.
    In the training phase, since several paths (marked in bold) can correspond to the correct analysis in the annotated corpus, we need to select one correct path yt as a reference for training.2 The next section describes our strategies for dealing with this issue.
    With this search space representation, we can consistently handle unknown words with character-level nodes.
    In other words, we use word-level nodes to identify known words and character-level nodes to identify unknown words.
    In the testing phase, we can use a dynamic programming algorithm to search for the most likely path out of all candidate paths.
  
  
    In this section, we describe our strategies for selecting the correct path yt in the training phase.
    As shown in Figure 1, the paths marked in bold can represent the correct annotation of the segmented sentence.
