a Treebank parser to recover predicate&#8211;argument dependencies.
    In this article we present an algorithmic method for obtaining a corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures from the Penn Treebank, together with some observations that we believe carry wider implications for similar attempts with other grammar formalisms and corpora.
    Earlier versions of the resulting corpus, CCGbank, have already been used to build a number of wide-coverage statistical parsers (Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman 2002; Hockenmaier and Steedman 2002; Hockenmaier 2003b, 2003a; Clark and Curran 2004, 2007), which recover both local and long-range dependencies directly and in a single pass.
    CCG is a linguistically expressive, but efficiently parseable, lexicalized grammar formalism that was specifically designed to provide a base-generative account of coordinate and relativized constructions like the following: CCG directly captures the non-local dependencies involved in these and other constructions, including
