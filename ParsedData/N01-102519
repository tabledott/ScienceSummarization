rt/End representation in Table 2.
    Table 3 shows the results of the weighted voting of four different voting methods: A: Uniform, B: Cross Validation ( ), C: VC bound, D: Leave-One-Out Bound.
    Table 4 shows the precision, recall and of the best result for each data set.
    We obtain the best accuracy when we apply IOE2-B representation for baseNP-S and chunking data set.
    In fact, we cannot find a significant difference in the performance between Inside/Outside(IOB1/IOB2/IOE1/IOE2) and Start/End(IOBES) representations.
    Sassano and Utsuro evaluate how the difference of the chunk representation would affect the performance of the systems based on different machine learning algorithms(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000).
    They report that Decision List system performs better with Start/End representation than with Inside/Outside, since Decision List considers the specific combination of features.
    As for Maximum Entropy, they report that it performs better with Inside/Outside representation than with S
