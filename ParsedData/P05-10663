scribe experiments involving machine translation from German to English.
    As an illustrative example of our method, consider the following German sentence, together with a &#8220;translation&#8221; into English that follows the original word order: Original sentence: Ich werde Ihnen die entsprechenden Anmerkungen aushaendigen, damit Sie das eventuell bei der Abstimmung uebernehmen koennen.
    The German word order in this case is substantially different from the word order that would be seen in English.
    As we will show later in this paper, translations of sentences of this type pose difficulties for phrase-based systems.
    In our approach we reorder the constituents in a parse of the German sentence to give the following word order, which is much closer to the target English word order (words which have been &#8220;moved&#8221; are underlined): We applied our approach to translation from German to English in the Europarl corpus.
    Source language sentences are reordered in test data, and also in t
