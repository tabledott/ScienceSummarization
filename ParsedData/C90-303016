l oper- ator "=**CLB" stating that there is a clause boundary before the word specified by the target.
  E.g., given that conjunctions are lexically marked by the inherent feature "&lt;Conj&gt;", the constraint: (@w =**CLB "&lt;Conj&gt;" (1 NOMHEAD) (2 VFIN)) states that there is a clause boundary before con- junction instances that precede a NOMHEAD fol- lowed by a finite verb (e.g., before the conjunction in a sentence such as John eats and Bill drinks).
  Syntactic constraints CG syntax is based on dependency and should assign flat, functional, surface labels, optimally one to each word-form.
  The labels are roughly the verb chain members: @+FAUXV (finite auxil- iary V), @-FAUXV (non-finite auxiliary V), @+FMAINV (finite main V), @-FMAINV (non- finite main V) .... ?
  nominal heads: @SUB J, @OBJ, @I-OBJ, @PCOMPL-S (subj.
  ), @PCOMPL- O (obj.
  ), @ADVL (adverbial) .... ?
  nominal modifiers: AN&gt; (adjective as premodi~ tier to N), DN&gt; (determiner aspremodifier toN), &lt;NOM (t-mstmodifier to nominal
