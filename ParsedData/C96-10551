from syntactic ues if we first divide the syntac- tic cues into distinct groupings that correlate with different word senses.
  Finally, we show that we can provide effective acquisition techniques for novel word senses using a combi- nation of online sources.
  1 In t roduct ion This paper addresses the issue of word-sense ambigu- ity in extraction from machine-readable resources for the construction of large-scale knowledge sources.
  We describe two experiments: one which ignored word- sense distinctions, resulting in 6.3% accuracy for seman- tic classification of verbs based on (Levin, 1993); and one which exploited word-sense distinctions, resulting in 97.9% accuracy.
  These experiments were dual pur- pose: (l) to validate the central thesis of the work of (Levin, 1993), i.e., that verb semantics and syntactic be- havior are predictably related; (2) to demonstrate hat a 15-fold improvement can be achieved in deriving se- mantic information from syntactic ues if we first divide the syntactic ues into dis
