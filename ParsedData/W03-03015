Systems making use of any additional resources (e.g. bilingual dictionaries, additional parallel corpora, and others) were classified under the Unlimited Resources category.
    Two sets of training data were made available. for pages containing potential parallel translations were manually identified (mainly from the archives of Romanian newspapers).
    Next, texts were automatically downloaded and sentence aligned.
    A manual verification of the alignment was also performed.
    These data collection process resulted in a corpus of about 850,000 Romanian words, and about 900,000 English words.

    For English and French, we used a version of the tokenizers provided within the EGYPT Toolkit2.

    Identical tokenization procedures were used for training, trial, and test data.
    Two sets of trial data were made available at the same time training data became available.
    Trial sets consisted of sentence aligned texts, provided
