ss whether the goal described in the instructions is achieved, i.e., the folder is deleted.
    The key idea of our approach is to leverage the validation process as the main source of supervision to guide learning.
    This form of supervision allows us to learn interpretations of natural language instructions when standard supervised techniques are not applicable, due to the lack of human-created annotations.
    Reinforcement learning is a natural framework for building models using validation from an environment (Sutton and Barto, 1998).
    We assume that supervision is provided in the form of a reward function that defines the quality of executed actions.
    During training, the learner repeatedly constructs action sequences for a set of given documents, executes those actions, and observes the resulting reward.
    The learner&#8217;s goal is to estimate a policy &#8212; a distribution over actions given instruction text and environment state &#8212; that maximizes future expected reward.
