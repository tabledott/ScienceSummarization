odifiers.
    However, the corresponding CCG derivation deliberately omits the dependency between dummies and drivers:17 This derivation uses one of the special binary type-changing rules (see Section 4.6) that takes into account that these appositives can only occur adjacent to commas.
    The Penn Treebank analyzes wh-questions, relative clauses, topicalization of complements, tough movement, cleft, and parasitic gaps in terms of movement.
    These constructions are frequent: The entire Treebank contains 16,056 *T* traces, including 8,877 NP traces, 4,120 S traces, 2,465 ADVP traces, 422 PP traces, and 210 other *T* traces.
    Sections 02&#8211;21 (39,604 sentences) contain 5,288 full subject relative clauses, as well as 459 full and 873 reduced object relative clauses.
    The dependencies involved in these constructions, however, are difficult to obtain from the output of standard parsers such as Collins (1999) or Charniak (2000), and require additional postprocessing that may introduce further noise an
