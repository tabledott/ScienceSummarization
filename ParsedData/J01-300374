 the gold standard.
    On the other hand, the algorithm still does not perform at expert level, as indicated by the fact that, for all experts, the lowest agreement score is with the program.
    One interesting question is whether experts and program disagree on the same verbs, and show similar patterns of errors.
    The program makes 18 errors, in total, compared to the gold standard.
    However, in 9 cases, at least one expert agrees with the classification given by the program.
    The program makes fewer errors on unergatives (3) and comparably many on unaccusatives and object-drops (7 and 8 respectively), indicating that members of the latter two classes are quite difficult to classify.
    This differs from the pattern of average agreement between the experts and Levin, who agree on 17.7 (of 20) unergatives, 16.7 (of 19) unaccusatives, and 11.3 (of 20) object-drops.
    This clearly indicates that the object-drop class is the most difficult for the human experts to define.
    This class is the most
