 testing texts, the FN team created almost 40 new frames.
			We cannot ask that participants hit uponthe new frame name, but the new frames are not created in a vacuum; as mentioned above, they are almost always added to the existing structure of frame to-frame relations; this allows us to give credit for assignment to frames which are not the precise onein the gold standard, but are close in terms of frame to-frame relations.
			Whenever participants?
			proposed frames were wrong but connected to the right frameby frame relations, partial credit was given, decreas ing by 20% for each link in the frame-frame relationgraph between the proposed frame and the gold stan dard.
			For FEs, each frame element had to match the gold standard frame element and contain at least the same head word in order to gain full credit; again, partial credit was given for frame elements related via FE-to-FE relations.
