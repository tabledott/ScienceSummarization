ctic representations.
    In Joyce, the Deep-Syntactic Representation encodes syntactic structure but not linear order (see Section 6 for details).
    2We are not aware of any example in which different text plans (as defined here) are needed for different languages.
    The fact that functionally similar texts may display different structures in different cultures should not be confused with language-specific constraints on text structure.
    Thus, if multi-lingual generation is desired, text planning and sentence planning ought to be performed by distinct components.
    On a more practical level, modularity in design and implementation can be exploited by parallel processing of independent modules.
    While the current implementations of Joyce do not allow for parallel execution, the incremental processing of parallel computing tasks on a serial machine is also advantageous, as is argued in the WIP project (Wahlster et al 1991; Harbusch et al 1991)3.
    Incrementality reduces the initial response time
