off method are Shown in the table below4.
    All results are for the IBM data.
    These figures should be taken in the context of the lower and upper bounds of 72.2%-88.2% proposed in section 2.3.
    On the surface the method described in [11R93] looks very similar to the backed-off estimate.
    For this reason the two methods deserve closer comparison.
    Hindle and Rooth used a partial parser to extract head nouns from a corpus, together with a preceding verb and a following preposition, giving a table of (v,n1,p) triples.
    An iterative, unsupervised method was then used to decide between noun and verb attachment for each triple.
    The decision was made as follows': If we ignore n2 then the IBM data is equivalent to Hindle and Rooth's (v,n1, p) triples. with the advantage of the attachment decision being known, allowing a supervised algorithm.
    The test used in [HR93] can then be stated as follows in our notation: This is effectively a comparison of the maximum likelihood estimates of Ill and ,
