orms as well as existing stochastic taggers, but has significant advantages over these taggers.
    The tagger is extremely portable.
    Many of the higher level procedures used to improve the performance of stochastic taggers would not readily transfer over to a different tag set or genre, and certainly would not transfer over to a different language.
    Everything except for the proper noun discovery procedure is automatically acquired by the rule-based tagger7, making it much more portable than a stochastic tagger.
    If the tagger were trained on a different corpus, a different set of patches suitable for that corpus would be found automatically.
    Large tables of statistics are not needed for the rulebased tagger.
    In a stochastic tagger, tens of thousands of lines of statistical information are needed to capture contextual information.
    This information is usually a table of trigram statistics, indicating for all tags taga, tag&amp; and tag, the probability that tag, follows taga and tagb.
