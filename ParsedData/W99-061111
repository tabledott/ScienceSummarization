er, NPi's semantic class is COMPANY, and NP2's class is OBJECT, generating a distance of oo via the semantic class feature.
    Therefore, dist(NP1,NP2) = oo and the two noun phrases are not considered coreferent.
    The coreference distance metric is largely contextindependent in that it determines the distance between two noun phrases using very little, if any, of their intervening or surrounding context.
    The clustering algorithm described below is responsible for coordinating these local coreference decisions across arbitrarily long contexts and, thus, implements a series of context-dependent coreference decisions.
    The clustering algorithm is given in Figure 2.
    Because noun phrases generally refer to noun phrases that precede them, we start at the end of the document and work backwards.
    Each noun phrase is compared to all preceding noun phrases.
    If the distance between two noun phrases is less than the clustering radius r, then their classes are considered for possible merging.
