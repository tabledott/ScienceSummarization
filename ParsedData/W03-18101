f non-compositionality or semantic opacity.
    We are specifically concerned with what are commonly referred to as phrasal verbs, or verb and particle constructions (Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002).
    As well as having idiosyncratic semantics, phrasals also display specific syntactic behaviour such as permitting particle movement when used in the transitive; for example: Jo ate up her food Jo ate her food up We are interested in phrasal verbs because we want to acquire predicate selectional preferences for word sense disambiguation (McCarthy et al., 2001).
    When acquiring such lexical information for a verb it is important to know when there is a special interpretation required for the verb and particle combination so that these combinations are handled separately from the simplex case.
    Whilst it is possible to put every single occurrence of a verb and particle combination into a lexicon this is not desirable.
    One wants to achieve generalisation and avoid redundancy, only storing details which
