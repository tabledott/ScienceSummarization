 probability Ot(j) is the probability of seeing the sequen {St+i, St+2, , ST} given that the Markov process is state i at time t. It follows that the probability of t entire sequence is for any tin the range 1 &lt;t &lt; T &#8212; 1.3 'For an introduction to hidden Markov modeling see [F biner and Juang, 1986].
    Given an initial choice for the parameters A, B, and H the expected number of transitions, , from state i to state j conditioned on the observation sequence S may be computed as follows: rescale.
    One approach premultiplies the a and 0 probabilities with an accumulating product depending on t [Levinson et al., 1983].
    Let ei1(i) = ai(i) and define and 1 .

    (5) In summary, to find maximum likelihood estimates for A, B, and H, via the Baum-Welch algorithm, one chooses some starting values, applies equations 3-5 to compute new values, and then iterates until convergence.
    It can be shown that this algorithm will converge, although possibly to a non-global maximum [B
