c devices with independently derived segments can be investigated.
    Grosz and Hirschberg (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992) derived a discourse structure for each text in their study, by incorporating the structural features agreed upon by all of their subjects.
    They then used statistical measures to characterize these discourse structures in terms of acousticprosodic features.
    Morris and Hirst (1991) structured a set of magazine texts using the theory of Grosz and Sidner (1986).
    They developed a lexical cohesion algorithm that used the information in a thesaurus to segment text, then qualitatively compared their segmentations with the results.
    Hearst (1993) derived a discourse structure for each text in her study, by incorporating the boundaries agreed upon by the majority of her subjects.
    Hearst developed a lexical algorithm based on information retrieval measurements to segment text, then qualitatively compared the results with the structures derived from her su
