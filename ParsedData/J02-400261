 10 occurrences in the whole verb class) and thus the negative context of the class was also removed: BETTER SOLUTION, CONTRAST, PRESENTATION, PROBLEM (&#8722; in last column).
    Again, the removal improved the performance of the Action feature.
    The algorithm for determining agents and actions relies on finite-state patterns over part-of-speech (POS) tags.
    Starting from each finite verb, the algorithm collects chains of auxiliaries belonging to the associated finite clause and thus determines the clause&#8217;s tense and voice.
    Other finite verbs and commas are assumed to be clause boundaries.
    Once the semantic verb is found, its stem is looked up in the action lexicon.
    Negation is determined if one of 32 fixed negation words is present in a six-word window to the right of the finite verb.
    As our classifier requires one unique value for each classified item for each feature, we had to choose one value for sentences containing more than one finite clause.
    We return the following v
