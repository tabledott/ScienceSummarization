    Using such invalid methods may seriously overestimate the significance of relatively rare events.
    Parametric statistical analysis based on the binomial or multinomial distribution extends the applicability of statistical methods to much smaller texts than models using normal distributions and shows good promise in early applications of the method.
    Further work is needed to develop software tools to allow the straightforward analysis of texts using these methods.
    Some of these tools have been developed and will be distributed by the Consortium for Lexical Research.

    In addition, there are a wide variety of distribution free methods that may avoid even the assumption that text can be modeled by multinomial distributions.
    Measures based on Fischer's exact method may prove even more satisfactory than the likelihood ratio meas
