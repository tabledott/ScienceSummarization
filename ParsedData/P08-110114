nored, we can still see that the chance for the overall best candidate to fall out of the beam is largely increased.
    Since the search space growth is exponential, increasing the fixed beam size is not effective in solving the problem.
    To solve the above problems, we developed a multiple beam search algorithm, which compares candidates only with complete tagged words, and enables the size of the search space to scale with the input size.
    The algorithm is shown in Figure 2.
    In this decoder, an agenda is assigned to each character in the input sentence, recording the B best segmented and tagged partial candidates ending with the character.
    The input sentence is still processed incrementally.
    However, now when a character is processed, existing partial candidates ending with any previous characters are available.
    Therefore, the decoder enumerates all possible tagged words ending with the current character, and combines each word with the partial candidates ending with its previous char
