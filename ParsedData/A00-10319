andard deviation of the maximum likelihood probabilities for the weights 0, (Samuelsson, 1993).
    This leaves room for interpretation.
    We use the longest suffix that we can find in the training set (i.e., for which the frequency is greater than or equal to 1), but at most 10 characters.
    This is an empirically determined choice.
    2) We use a context-independent approach for 0&#8222; as we did for the contextual weights A.
    It turned out to be a good choice to set all 0, to the standard deviation of the unconditioned maximum likelihood probabilities of the tags in the training corpus, i.e., we set for all i = 0 ... m &#8212; 1, using a tagset of s tags and the average (11) This usually yields values in the range 0,03 ... 0.10.
    3) We use different estimates for uppercase and lowercase words, i.e., we maintain two different suffix tries depending on the capitalization of the word.
    This information improves the tagging results.
    4) Another freedom concerns the choice of the words in the
