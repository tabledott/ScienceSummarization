hese sentences for the logical form eat(john, X) (because of its incoherence) and would generate 'John ate' for the logical form eat (john, banana) (because of its incompleteness).
    Coherence can be achieved by removing the confusion between object-level and metalevel variables mentioned above, that is, by treating logicalform variables as constants at the description level.
    In practice, this can be achieved by replacing each variable in the semantics from which we are generating by a new distinct constant (for instance with the numbervars predicate built into some implementations of Prolog).
    These new constants will not unify with any augmentations to the semantics.
    A suitable modification of our generator would be gen(Cat, String) :cat_semantics(Cat,Sem), numbervars(Sen,0,_), generate(node(Cat,String,0)).
    This leaves us with the completeness problem.
    This problem arises when there are phrases whose semantics are not ground at the description level, but instead subsume the goal logical
