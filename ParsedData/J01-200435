branch followed by a right branch (POS nodes that are leftmost within their constituent); and the third number is for the contexts where the right branch is always followed (POS nodes that are not leftmost within their constituent).
    For example, (4,3,2) would represent a conditional probability model that (i) returns NULL for all functions below level 4 in all contexts; (ii) returns NULL for all functions below level 3 if the left-hand side is a POS; and (iii) returns NULL for all functions below level 2 for nonleftmost POS expansions.
    Table 1 gives a breakdown of the different levels of conditioning information used in the empirical trials, with a mnemonic label that will be used when presenting results.
    These different levels were chosen as somewhat natural points at which to observe how much of an effect increasing the conditioning information has.
    We first include structural information from the context, namely, node labels from constituents in the left context.
    Then we add lexical inf
