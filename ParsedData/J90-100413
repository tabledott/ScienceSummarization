ategorization lists may be concatenated by syntactic rules (MoortThe string of verbs is analyzed by appending their subcategorization lists as in Figure 2.
    Subcategorization lists under this analysis can have any length, and it is impossible to predict from a semantic structure the size of its corresponding subcategorization list merely by examining the lexicon.
    Strzalkowski refers to this problem quite aptly as constituting a deadlock situation.
    He notes that by combining deadlock-prone rules (using a technique akin to partial execution2) many deadlock-prone rules can be replaced by rules that allow reordering; however, he states that &amp;quot;the general solution to this normalization problem is still under investigation.&amp;quot; We think that such a general solution is unlikely because of cases like the one above in which no finite amount of partial execution can necessarily bring sufficient information to bear on the rule to allow ordering.
    The rule would have to be partially executed w
