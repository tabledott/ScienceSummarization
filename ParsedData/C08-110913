eatures and baseline with combination features added.
			Theprecision and recall for the top performing models are shown in Table 2.
			These results do not in clude the extraneous use filter; this filter generally increased precision by as much as 2% and recall by as much as 5%.
			Evaluation Metrics In the tasks of determiner and preposition selection in well-formed, nativetexts (such as (Knight and Chander, 1994), (Min nen et al, 2000), (Turner and Charniak, 2007) and (Gamon et al, 2008)), the evaluation metric most commonly used is accuracy.
			In these tasks, one compares the system?s output on a determiner or preposition to the gold standard of what the writeroriginally wrote.
			However, in the tasks of deter miner and preposition error detection, precision and recall are better metrics to use because oneis only concerned with a subset of the preposi tions (or determiners), those used incorrectly, as opposed to all of them in the selection task.
			In essence, accuracy has the problem of distorting sys
