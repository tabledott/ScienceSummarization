information, propagate the same information to the defined synset as well.
    Each hyponym of the concept {person, individual, human}, categorized as PERSON has expression G initialized to f V m, since all lexemes represent persons, that can be either males or females.
    Whenever one of the two heuristics previously defined can be applied at any node S from this subhierarchy, three operations take place: t&gt; Operation 1: We update G with the new expression brough forward by the heuristic. t&gt; Operation 2: We propagate all the expression to the hyponyms of S; t&gt; Operation 3: We revisit the whole PERSON subhierarchy, in search for concepts D that are defined with glosses that use any of the words from synset S or any word from any of its hyponyms.
    Whenever we find such a word, we update its G expression to G(S).
    We also note that many words are polysemous, thus a word w may have multiple senses under the PERSON sub-hierarchy and moreover, each sense might have a different G expression.
