ection 4.2 Figure 9 illustrates the last possibility.
    The focus space for the flashback &#8212; FSABc &#8212; is pushed onto the stack after an appropriate number of spaces, including the focus space for the outer segment &#8212; FSBill, have been popped from the main stack and pushed onto an auxiliary stack.
    All of the entities in the focus spaces remaining on the main stack are normally accessible for reference, but none of those on the auxiliary stack are.
    In the example in the figure, entities in the spaces from FSA to FSB are accessible as well (though less salient than) those in space FSABc.
    Evidence for this kind of stack behavior could come from discourses in which phrases in the segment about ABC could refer to entities represented in FSB, but not to those in FSBill or FSc.
    After an explicit indication that there is a return to DSPBili (e.g., the Now back to Bill used in this example), any focus spaces left on the stack from the flashback are popped off, and all spaces on the auxi
