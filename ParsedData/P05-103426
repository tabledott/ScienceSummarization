sentation for syntax in MT.
    Dependency analysis, in contrast to constituency analysis, tends to bring semantically related elements together (e.g., verbs become adjacent to all their arguments) and is better suited to lexicalized models, such as the ones presented in this paper.
  
  
    The most important contribution of our system is a linguistically motivated ordering approach based on the source dependency tree, yet this paper only explores one possible model.
    Different model structures, machine learning techniques, and target feature representations all have the potential for significant improvements.
    Currently we only consider the top parse of an input sentence.
    One means of considering alternate possibilities is to build a packed forest of dependency trees and use this in decoding translations of each input sentence.
    As noted above, our approach shows particular promise for language pairs such as EnglishJapanese that exhibit large-scale reordering and have proven difficult for stri
