 the Chinese-English test set, where there was no significant change.
    But with fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction, we obtained an improvement of +0.6 on both Chinese-English sets, and +0.7/+0.8 on the ArabicEnglish sets.
    Applying the heuristic for nesting phrases reduced the grammar sizes dramatically (by a factor of 2.4 for Chinese and 4.2 for Arabic) but, interestingly, had almost no effect on translation quality: a slight decrease in BLEU on the Arabic-English development set and no significant difference on the other sets.
    This suggests that the strength of fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction lies in its ability to break up flat structures and to reconcile the source and target trees with each other, rather than multiple restructurings of the training trees.
    We then took a closer look at the behavior of the string-to-string and fuzzy tree-to-tree grammars (without the nesting heuristic).
    Because the rules of these grammars are in one-to-one correspondence, we can analyze the string-to-string syst
