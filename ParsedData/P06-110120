example of continental.
    Suppose we are iterating through each of the 99 possible synsets under which we might add continental as a hyponym, and we come to the synset airline#n#2 in WordNet 2.1, i.e.
    &#8220;a commercial organization serving as a common carrier.&#8221; In this case we will iterate through each piece of hypernym and coordinate evidence; we find that the relation H(continental, carrier) is satisfied with high probability for the specific synset carrier#n#S, the grandparent of airline#n#2; thus the factor AT(H3(continental, carrier#n#S)) is included in the factor of the set of implied relations AT (I(H1(continental, airline#n#2))).
    Suppose we instead evaluate the first synset of airline, i.e., airline#n#1, with the gloss &#8220;a hose that carries air under pressure.&#8221; For this synset none of the other 20 relationships directly implied by hypernym evidence or the 5 relationships implied by the coordinate evidence are implied by adding the single link H1(continental,airline#n#1); t
