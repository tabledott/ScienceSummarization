ion accuracy on unla3Training, development, and test data in PDT already contains POS tags assigned by the &#8216;feature-based tagger&#8217;. beled dependency parsing.
    We ignore the parentpredictions of punctuation tokens for English, while we retain all the punctuation tokens for Czech.
    These settings match the evaluation setting in previous work such as (McDonald et al., 2005a; Koo et al., 2008).
    We used the method proposed by (Carreras, 2007) for our second-order parsing model.
    Since this method only considers projective dependency structures, we &#8220;projectivized&#8221; the PDT training data in the same way as (Koo et al., 2008).
    We used a non-projective model, trained using an application of the matrix-tree theorem (Koo et al., 2007; Smith and Smith, 2007; McDonald and Satta, 2007) for the first-order Czech models, and projective parsers for all other models.
    As shown in Section 2, SS-SCMs with 1st-order parsing models have two tunable parameters, C and q, corresponding to the
