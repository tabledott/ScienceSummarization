IDF to produce clusters of news articles on the same event.
    We developed a new technique for multi-document summarization (or MDS), called centroid-based summarization (CBS) which uses as input the centroids of the clusters produced by C1DR to identify which sentences are central to the topic of the cluster, rather than the individual articles.
    We have implemented CBS in a system, named MEAD.
    The main contributions of this paper are: the development of a centroid-based multi-document summarizer, the use of cluster-based sentence utility (CBSU) and cross-sentence informational subsumption (CSIS) for evaluation of single and multi-document summaries, two user studies that support our findings, and an evaluation of MEAD.
    An event cluster, produced by a TDT system, consists of chronologically ordered news articles from multiple sources, which describe an event as it develops over time.
    Event clusters range from2 to 10 documents from which MEAD produces summaries in the form of sentence extract
