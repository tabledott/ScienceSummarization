l similarity driven algorithm then proceeds as follows: At the end, the output is a list of generalized paraphrase patterns with named entity types as variables.
    For example, the algorithm may generate the following two patterns as paraphrases: (PERSON) is promoted to (POST) the promotion of (PERSON) to (POST) is decided As a later refinement, Sekine (2005) makes a similar attempt at using distributional similarity over named entity pairs in order to produce a list of fully lexicalized phrasal paraphrases for specific concepts represented by keywords.
    The idea of enlisting named entities as proxies for detecting semantic equivalence is interesting and has certainly been explored before (see the discussion regarding Pas&#184;ca and Dienes [2005] in Section 3.2).
    However, it has some obvious disadvantages.
    The authors manually evaluate the technique by generating paraphrases for two specific domains (arrest events and personnel hirings) and find that while the precision is reasonably good, the c
