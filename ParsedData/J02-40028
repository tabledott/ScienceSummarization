ociations of words to certain hidden senses classes and associations between the classes themselves.
    11 While it may be worthwhile to base such a model on preexisting sense classes (Resnik, 1992), in the work described here we look at how to derive the classes directly from distributional data.
    162 We have demonstrated that ageneral divisive clustering procedurefor probability distributions can be used to group words according to their participation in particular grammatical relations with other words.
    CONTRAST 9 His notion ofsimilarity seems to agree with our intuitions in many cases, but it is not clear how it can be used directly to construct word classes and corresponding models of association.
    14 Class construction is then combinatorially very demanding and depends on frequency counts for joint events involving particular words, a potentially unreliable source of information as we noted above.
