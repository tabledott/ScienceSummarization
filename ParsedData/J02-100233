 Type C errors, the penalty is 2e, so it is also k on average.
    Thus, we get p = a2 + 2b + a2 = a + b2.
    The results, arranged by segment size variation, are as follows: (20, 30) (15, 35) (10, 40) (5, 45) Estimate 0.363 0.364 0.359 0.355 Actual 0.376 0.370 0.357 0.343 These estimates do not correspond to the actual results quite as closely as the estimates for Pk and Pk did, but they are still very close.
    One reason why these estimates are a little less accurate is that for WD, Type C errors are more affected by variation in segment size than either Type A or Type B errors.
    This is clear from the fact that the decrease is greater in the actual data than in the estimate.
    Table 2 shows data similar to those of Table 1, but using two different probability values for error occurrence: 0.05 and 0.25.
    These results have the same tendencies as those shown above for p = 0.5.
    The second set of tests was designed to assess the performance of the metrics on algorithms prone to different kinds o
