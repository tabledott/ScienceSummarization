nce of the output text, we identify blocks of topically related themes and then apply chronological ordering on blocks of themes using theme time stamps (Barzilay, Elhadad, and McKeown 2002).
    These stages produce a sorted set of themes which are passed as input to the sentence fusion component, described in the next section.
  
  
    Given a group of similar sentences&#8212;a theme&#8212;the problem is to create a concise and fluent fusion of information, reflecting facts common to all sentences.
    (An example of a fusion sentence is shown in Table 1.)
    To achieve this goal we need to identify phrases common to most theme sentences, then combine them into a new sentence.
    At one extreme, we might consider a shallow approach to the fusion problem, adapting the &#8220;bag of words&#8221; approach.
    However, sentence intersection in a set-theoretic sense produces poor results.
    For example, the intersection of the first two sentences from the theme shown in Table 1 is (the, fired, antitank, at
