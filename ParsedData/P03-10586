glish texts are tokenized so that a punctuation symbol is separated from its preceding word.
    For the Chinese texts, we performed word segmentation, so that Chinese characters are segmented into words.
    The resulting parallel texts are then input to the GIZA++ software (Och and Ney 2000) for word alignment.
    In the output of GIZA++, each English word token is aligned to some Chinese word token.
    The alignment result contains much noise, especially for words with low frequency counts.
    In this step, we will decide on the sense classes of an English word w that are relevant to translating w into Chinese.
    We will illustrate with the noun channel, which is one of the nouns evaluated in the English lexical sample task of SENSEVAL-2.
    We rely on two sources to decide on the sense classes of w: (i) The sense definitions in WordNet 1.7, which lists seven senses for the noun channel.
    Two senses are lumped together if they are translated in the same way in Chinese.
    For example, sense 1 and
