topic shift, one can only use the general trends as a basis from which to compare different algorithms.
    Since the goals of TextTiling are better served by algorithms that produce more rather than fewer boundaries, I set the cutoff for &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; boundaries to three rather than four judges per paragraph.6 The remaining gaps are considered nonboundaries.
  
  
    Figure 4 shows a plot of the results of applying the block comparison algorithm to the Stargazer text.
    When the lowermost portion of a valley is not located at a paragraph gap, the judgment is moved to the nearest paragraph gap.7 For the most part, the regions of strong similarity correspond to the regions of strong agreement among the readers.
    (The results for this text were fifth highest out of the 13 test texts.)
    Note however, that the similarity information around paragraph 12 is weak.
    This paragraph briefly summarizes the contents of the previous three paragraphs; much of the terminol'Paragraphs of three or fewer
