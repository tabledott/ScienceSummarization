on class bits gives us a few percentage points in performance, but the ME model should gain more from other word classing schemes which are better tuned to the PP-attachment problem.
  A scheme in which the word classes are built from the observed attach- ment preferences of words ought to outperform the mutual information clustering method, which uses only word bigram distributions[10].

  Any implementation f this model using the rest of the sentence would require features on other words, and perhaps features on the sentences parse tree structure, coupled with an efficient incremental search.
  Such improvements should boost the performance of the model to that o
