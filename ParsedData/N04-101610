r the object noun, respectively.
    Table 4 lists Prescher et al.&#8217;s results for the two corpora and for both models together with a random baseline (select a target noun at random) and a frequency baseline (select the most frequent target noun).
    Grefenstette&#8217;s (1998) evaluation was restricted to compounds that are listed in a dictionary.
    These compounds are presumably well-established and fairly frequent, which makes it easy to obtain reliable web frequencies.
    We wanted to test if the web-based approach extends from lexicalized compounds to productive syntactic units for which dictionary entries do not exist.
    We therefore performed our evaluation using Prescher et al.&#8217;s (2000) test set of verb-object pairs.
    Web counts were retrieved for all possible verb-object translations; the most likely one was selected using either co-occurrence frequency (f(v,n)) or conditional probability (f (v,n)/f (n)).
    The web counts were gathered using inflected queries involving the verb,
