ducing data that we could use to evaluate the performance of a system.
    The classification schemes we used were simpler than those proposed in the literature just mentioned and were motivated, on the one hand, by the desire to make the annotation uncomplicated for the subjects employed in the empirical analysis and, on the other hand, by our intention to use the annotation to get art estimate of how well a system using only limited lexical arid encyclopedic knowledge could do.'
    We ran two experiments, using two slightly different classification schemes.
    In the first experiment we used the following three classes:' In the second experiment we treated all anaphoric definite descriptions as part of one class (direct anaphora + bridging (i)), and all inferrables as part of a different class (bridging (ii)), without significant changes in the agreement results.
    Agreement among annotators was measured using the K statistic (Siegel and Castellan 1988; Carletta 1996).
    K measures agreement among k a
