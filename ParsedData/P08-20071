pace of bijective phrase alignments (see below), no polynomial time algorithms for exact inference have been exhibited.
    Indeed, Marcu and Wong (2002) conjectures that none exist.
    In this paper, we show that Viterbi inference in this full space is NP-hard, while computing expectations is #P-hard.
    On the other hand, we give a compact formulation of Viterbi inference as an integer linear program (ILP).
    Using this formulation, exact solutions to the Viterbi search problem can be found by highly optimized, general purpose ILP solvers.
    While ILP is of course also NP-hard, we show that, empirically, exact solutions are found very quickly for most problem instances.
    In an experiment intended to illustrate the practicality of the ILP approach, we show speed and search accuracy results for aligning phrases under a standard phrase translation model.
  
  
    Rather than focus on a particular model, we describe four problems that arise in training phrase alignment models.
