(2006) and then remove the lexicalized rules.
    We remove the Galley et al.&#8217;s lexicalized rules because they are either already accounted for by the minimally syntactified, lexicalized, phrasebased-compatible xRS rules or they subsume noncontinuous source-target phrase pairs.
    It is worth mentioning that, in our framework, a rule is defined to be &#8220;minimal&#8221; with respect to a foreign/source language phrase, i.e., it is the minimal xRS rule that yields that source phrase.
    In contrast, in the work of Galley et al. (2004; 2006), a rule is defined to be minimal when it is necessary in order to explain a (7r, F, A) tuple.
    Under SPMT model 1, the tree in Figure 2 can be produced, for example, by the following derivation: r4(r9(r7),r3(r6(r12(rs)))).
    We hypothesize that composed rules, i.e., rules that can be decomposed via the application of a sequence of Model 1 rules may improve the performance of an SPMT system.
    For example, although the minimal Model 1 rules r11 and r13 are s
