e notation of Ando and Zhang (2005), we can write the supervised training objective of SCL on the source domain as where y is the label.
    The weight vector w E Rd weighs the original features, while v E Rk weighs the projected features.
    Ando and Zhang (2005) and Blitzer et al. (2006) suggest &#955; = 10&#8722;4, &#181; = 0, which we have used in our results so far.
    Suppose now that we have trained source model weight vectors ws and vs. A small amount of target domain data is probably insufficient to significantly change w, but we can correct v, which is much smaller.
    We augment each labeled target instance xj with the label assigned by the source domain classifier (Florian et al., 2004; Blitzer et al., 2006).
    Then we solve Since we don&#8217;t want to deviate significantly from the source parameters, we set &#955; = &#181; = 10&#8722;1.
    Figure 2 shows the corrected SCL-MI model using 50 target domain labeled instances.
    We chose this number since we believe it to be a reasonable amou
