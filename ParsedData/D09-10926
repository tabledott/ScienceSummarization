opic&#8221; consists of a set of discrete distributions over words&#8212;one for each language l = 1, ... , L. In other words, rather than using a single set of topics &#934; = {&#966;1, ... , &#966;T}, as in LDA, there are L sets of language-specific topics, &#934;1, ... , &#934;L, each of which is drawn from a language-specific symmetric Dirichlet with concentration parameter &#946;l.
    Anew document tuple w = (w1, ... , wL) is generated by first drawing a tuple-specific topic distribution from an asymmetric Dirichlet prior with concentration parameter &#945; and base measure m: Then, for each language l, a latent topic assignment is drawn for each token in that language: Finally, the observed tokens are themselves drawn using the language-specific topic parameters: wl &#8764; P(wl  |zl,&#934;l) = 11n &#966;lwl |zl .
    (3) The graphical model is shown in figure 1.
    Given a corpus of training and test document tuples&#8212;W and W', respectively&#8212;two possible inference tasks of interest are: comp
