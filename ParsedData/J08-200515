itate full parsing.
  A clause, on the other hand, is the clausal constituent as defined by the treebank standard.
  An example of chunks and clauses is shown in Figure 1.
  3.1 Pruning When the full parse tree of a sentence is available, only the constituents in the parse tree are considered as argument candidates.
  Our system exploits the heuristic rules introduced by Xue and Palmer (2004) to filter out simple constituents that are very unlikely to be arguments.
  This pruning method is a recursive process starting from the target verb.
  It first returns the siblings of the verb as candidates; then it moves to the parent of the verb, and collects the siblings again.
  The process goes on until it reaches the root.
  In addition, if a constituent is a PP (prepositional phrase), its children are also collected.
  For example, in Figure 1, if the predicate (target verb) is assume, the pruning heuristic will output: [PP by John Smith who has been elected deputy chairman], [NP John Smith who has been elected d
