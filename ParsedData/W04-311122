e opennlp package available athttp://www.sf.net/projects/opennlp.It has now been retrained using 315 files (122 from the oncology domain, 193 from the cyp domain).
    Figure 4 shows the improvement of the new vs. the old POS tagger on the same 294 files that have been hand-corrected.
    These results are based on testing files that have already been tokenized, and thus are an evaluation only of the POS tagger and not the tokenizer.
    While not directly comparable to results such as (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), due to the different tag sets and tokenization, they are in the same general range.7 The oncology and cyp entity annotation, as well as the treebanking are still being done fully manually, although that will change in the near future.
    Initial results for a tagger to identify the various components of a variation relation are promising, although not yet integrated into annotation process.
    The tagger is based on the implementation of Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) in the Mall
