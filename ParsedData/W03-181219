h corpus statistics.
    He defines the similarity between two words as the information content of the lowest superordinate in the hierarchy, defining the information content of a concept c (where a concept is the WordNet class containing the word) to be the negative of its log likelihood.
    This is calculated over a corpus of text. where C0 is the lowest class in the hierarchy that subsumes both classes. lations&#8221; of different strength to determine the similarity of word senses, conditioned on the type, direction and relative distance of edges separating them.
    The Patwardhan et al. (2003) implementation that we used calculates the information values from SemCor, a semantically tagged subset of the Brown corpus.
    Note that the first two similarity measures operate over nouns only, while the last can be applied to any word class.
    The similarity measures described above calculate the similarity between a pair of senses.
    In the case that a given constituent word and/or MWE occur with more t
