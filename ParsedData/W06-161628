  In this paper we have presented a novel approach for inference using ILP.
    While previous approaches which use ILP for decoding have solved each integer linear program in one run, we incrementally add constraints and solve the resulting program until no more constraints are violated.
    This allows us to efficiently use ILP for dependency parsing and add constraints which provide a significant improvement over the current stateof-the-art parser (McDonald et al., 2005b) on the Dutch Alpino corpus (see bl row in Table 1).
    Although slower than the baseline approach, our method can still parse large sentences (more than 50 tokens) in a reasonable amount of time (less than a minute).
    We have shown that parsing time can be significantly reduced using a simple approximation which only marginally degrades performance.
    Furthermore, we believe that the method has potential for further extensions and applications.
