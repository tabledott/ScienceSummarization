ng the relation of cooccurrence of two words within a limited distance in a sentence.
    The proposed method, however, is general and is applicable for any type of lexical cooccurrence.
    The method was evaluated in two experiments.
    In the first one we achieved a complete scenario of the use of the estimation method, by implementing a variant of the disambiguation method in (Dagan et al., 1991), for sense selection in machine translation.
    The estimation method was then successfully used to increase the coverage of the disambiguation method by 15%, with an increase of the overall precision compared to a naive, frequency based, method.
    In the second experiment we evaluated the estimation method on a data recovery task.
    The task simulates a typical scenario in disambiguation, and also relates to theoretical questions about redundancy and idiosyncrasy in cooccurrence data.
    In this evaluation, which involved 300 examples, the performance of the estimation method was by 27% better than freque
