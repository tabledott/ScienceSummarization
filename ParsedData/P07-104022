score is improved by 0.97 points.
    Also, the METEOR score using the METEOR optimized weights is very high.
    However, the other scores are worse in common with the tuning set results.
    The tuning set results on the Chinese to English NIST MT03+MT04 task are shown in Table 3.
    The baseline combination weights were tuned to optimize BLEU.
    Again, the best scores on each metric are obtained by the combination tuned for that metric.
    Only the METEOR score of the TER tuned combination is worse than the METEOR scores of systems E and F - other combinations are better than any single system on all metrics apart from the METEOR tuned combinations.
    The test set results follow clearly the tuning results again - the TER tuned combination is the best in terms of TER, the BLEU tuned in terms of BLEU, and the METEOR tuned in terms of METEOR.
    Compared to the baseline, the BLEU score of the BLEU tuned combination is improved by 1.47 points.
    Again, the METEOR tuned weights hurt the other metrics s
