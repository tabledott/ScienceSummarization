    Although this study shows that unigram co-occurrence statistics exhibit some good properties in summary evaluation, it still does not correlate to human assessment 100% of the time.
    There is more to be desired in the recall and precision of significance test agreement with manual evaluation.
    We are starting to explore various metrics suggested in Donaway et al. (2000).
    For example, weight n-gram matches differently according to their information content measured by tf, tfidf, or SVD.
    In fact, NIST MT automatic scoring metric (NIST 2002) already integrates such modifications.
    One future direction includes using an automatic question answer test as demonstrated in the pilot study in SUMMAC (Mani et al. 1998).
    In that study, an automatic scoring script developed by Chris Buckley showed high correlation with human evaluations, although the experiment was only tested on a small set of 3 topics.
