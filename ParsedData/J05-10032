 which rerank the output of an existing probabilistic parser.
    The base parser produces a set of candidate parses for each input sentence, with associated probabilities that define an initial ranking of these parses.
    A second model then attempts to improve upon this initial ranking, using additional features of the tree as evidence.
    The strength of our approach is that it allows a tree to be represented as an arbitrary set offeatures, without concerns about how these features interact or overlap and without the need to define a derivation or a generative model which takes these features into account.
    We introduce a new method for the reranking task, based on the boosting approach to ranking problems described in Freund et al. (1998).
    We apply the boosting method to parsing the Wall Street Journal treebank.
    The method combined the log-likelihood under a baseline model (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 features over parse trees that were not included in the
