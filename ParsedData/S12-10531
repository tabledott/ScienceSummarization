    Cross-linguality represents a dimension of the TE recognition problem that has been so far only partially investigated.
    The great potential for integrating monolingual TE recognition components into NLP architectures has been reported in several areas, including question answering, information retrieval, information extraction, and document summarization.
    However, mainly due to the absence of cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) recognition
  
  
    components, similar improvements have not been achieved yet in any cross-lingual application.
    The CLTE task aims at prompting research to fill this gap.
    Along such direction, research can now benefit from recent advances in other fields, especially machine translation (MT), and the availability of: i) large amounts of parallel and comparable corpora in many languages, ii) open source software to compute word-alignments from parallel corpora, and iii) open source software to set up MT systems.
