    We also plan to increase the number of algorithms implemented by some existing modules, such as the text classification module.
    Finding suitable corpora is a prerequisite for many student assignments and projects.
    We are therefore putting together a collection of corpora containing data appropriate for every module defined by the toolkit.
    NLTK is an open source project, and we welcome any contributions.
    Readers who are interested in contributing to NLTK, or who have suggestions for improvements, are encouraged to contact the authors.
  
  
    We are indebted to our students for feedback on the toolkit, and to anonymous reviewers, Jee Bang, and the workshop organizers for comments on an earlier version of this paper.
    We are grateful to Mitch Marcus and the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania for sponsoring the work reported here.
