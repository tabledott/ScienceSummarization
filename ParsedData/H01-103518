tion-induced French tagger achieves performance nearly as high as its original training source.
  Thus further improvements should be expected from higher quality English training sources.
  MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS INDUCTION Bilingual corpora can also serve as a very successful bridge for aligning complex inflected word forms in a new language with their root forms, even when their surface similarity is quite different or highly irregular.

  However, in the case of morphology induction, such direct associations are relatively rare given that infle
