us layers of semantics that it tries to capture.
    As one of its layers, it has created a corpus for general anaphoric coreference that covers entities and events not limited to noun phrases or a limited set of entity types.
    A small portion of this corpus from the newswire and broadcast news genres (-120k) was recently used for a SEMEVAL task (Recasens et al., 2010).
    As mentioned earlier, the coreference layer in OntoNotes constitutes just one part of a multi-layered, integrated annotation of shallow semantic structure in text with high interannotator agreement, which also provides a unique opportunity for performing joint inference over a substantial body of data.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 presents an overview of the OntoNotes corpus.
    Section 3 describes the coreference annotation in OntoNotes.
    Section 4 then describes the shared task, including the data provided and the evaluation criteria.
    Sections 5 and 6 then describe the participating sy
