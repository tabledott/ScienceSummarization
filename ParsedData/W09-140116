17; parsing model (Bikel, 2004) and trained on PTB, and the reranking parser of (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) with the self-trained biomedical parsing model of (McClosky and Charniak, 2008)4.
    We also applied the GDep5, native dependency parser trained on the GENIA Treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005), and a version of the C&amp;C CCG deep parser6 adapted to biomedical text (Rimell and Clark, 2008).
    The text of all documents was segmented and tokenized using the GENIA Sentence Splitter and the GENIA Tagger, provided by U-Compare.
    The same segmentation was enforced for all parsers, which were run using default settings.
    Both the native output of each parser and a representation in the popular Stanford Dependency (SD) format (de Marneffe et al., 2006) were provided.
    The SD representation was created using the Stanford tools7 to convert from the PTB scheme, the custom conversion introduced by (Rimell and Clark, 2008) for the C&amp;C CCG parser, and a simple format-only conversion for GDep.
