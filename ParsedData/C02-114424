			It can handle a large number of elements, a large number of output clusters, and a large sparse feature space.
			It discovers clusters using well scattered tight clusters called committees.
			In our experiments, we showed that CBC outperforms several well known hierarchical, partitional, and hybrid clustering algorithms in cluster quality.
			For example, in one experiment, CBC outperforms K-means by 4.25%.
			By comparing the CBC clusters with WordNet classes, we not only find errors in CBC, but also oversights in WordNet.
			Evaluating cluster quality has always been a difficult task.
			We presented a new evaluation methodology that is based on the editing distance between output clusters and classes extracted from WordNet (the answer key).
