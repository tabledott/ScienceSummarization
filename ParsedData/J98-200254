   Namely, if we let L',,,&#8222;(A4T, ST) denote the minimum description length (as defined by [17] and [181) achievable for (sub)model MT on (sub)sample ST contained in (sub)tree T, Ps(n) the MLE estimate for node n using the entire sample S. and root(T) the root node of tree T, then we have: (MT, ST) min { E ST,), L' ( ( [root( T)l, [Ps (Toot( TM ), ST) } (20) The rest of the proof proceeds by induction.
    First, when T is of a single leaf node, the submodel consisting solely of the node and the MLE of the generation probability for the class represented by T is returned, which is clearly a submodel with minimum description length in the subtree T. Next, inductively assume that Find-MDL(T') correctly outputs a (sub)model with the minimum description length for any tree T' of size less than n. Then, given a tree T of size n whose root node has at least two children, say T : i = 1,. .

    ,k, for each T,, Find-MDL(T1) returns a (sub)model with the minimum description length by the inductive hypothesi
