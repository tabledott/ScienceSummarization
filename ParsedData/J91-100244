ng patterns in the thesaurus.
    Their student Bryan (1973) proposed a graph-theoretic model of the thesaurus.
    A boolean matrix is created with words on one axis and categories on the other.
    A cell is marked as true if a word associated with a cell intersects with the category associated with a cell.
    Paths or chains in this model are formed by traveling along rows or columns to other true cells.
    Semantic &amp;quot;neighborhoods&amp;quot; are grown, consisting of the set of chains emanating from an entry.
    It was found that without some concept of chain strength, the semantic relatedness of these neighborhoods decays, partly due to homographs.
    Strong links are defined in terms of the degree of overlap between categories and words.
    A strong link exists where at least two categories contain more than one word in common, or at least two words contain more than one category in common.
    The use of strong links was found to enable the growth of strong semantic chains with homograph dis
