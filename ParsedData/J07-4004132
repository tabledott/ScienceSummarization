orrect for all levels which subsume both ncmod and xmod, for example mod.
    Thus the scores at the most general level in the GR hierarchy (dependent) correspond to unlabeled accuracy scores.
    The micro-averaged scores are calculated by aggregating the counts for all the relations in the hierarchy, whereas the macro-averaged scores are the mean of the individual scores for each relation (Briscoe, Carroll, and Watson 2006).
    The results show that the performance of the CCG parser is higher than RASP overall, and also higher on the majority of GR types.
    Relations on which the CCG parser performs particularly well, relative to RASP, are conj, det, ncmod, cmod, ncsubj, dobj, obj2, and ccomp.
    The relations for which the CCG parser performs poorly are some of the less frequent relations: ta, pmod, xsubj, csubj, and pcomp; in fact pmod and pcomp are not in the current CCG dependencies to GRs mapping.
    The overall F-score for the CCG parser, 81.14%, is only 3.6 points below that for CCGbank, which p
