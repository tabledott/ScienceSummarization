n in Table 3 is normalised to produce a matrix M, in which each entry depicts the estimated conditional probability P(Gi|Cj).
    Given an instance I of tw from the evaluation corpus, a row cluster vector IC is created, in which each entry k corresponds to the score assigned to Ck to be the winning cluster for instance I.
    The product of IC and M provides a row sense vector, IG, in which the highest scoring entry a denotes that Ga is the winning sense.
    For example, if we produce the row cluster vector [C1 = 0.8,C2 = 0.1, C3 = 0.1, C4=0.0],and multiply it with the normalised matrix of Table 3, then we would get a row sense vector in which G3 would be the winning sense with a score equal to 0.43.
  
  
    In this section, we present the results of the 26 systems along with two baselines.
    The first baseline, Most Frequent Sense (MFS), groups all testing instances of a target word into one cluster.
    The second baseline, Random, randomly assigns an instance to one out of four clusters.
    The numbe
