h this implementation of the algorithm, sentences of up to 10 words have been parsed correctly, using a grammar which contains over 300 disjunctions.
    The time required for most sentences is in the range of 10 to 300 seconds, running on lisp machine hardware.
    The fact that sentences can be parsed at all with a grammar containing this many disjunctions indicates that the algorithm is performing much better than its theoretical worst case time of 0(2d).2 The timings, shown in Table 1, obtained from the experimental parser for systemic grammar also indicate that a dramatic increase in the number of disjunctions in the grammar does not result in an exponential increase in parse time.
    C08 is a grammar containing 98 disjunctions, 2Consider, 23&amp;quot; i:.
    28&#176;, and 280 is taken to be a rough estimate of the number of particles in the universe. and G440 is a grammar containing 440 disjunctions.
    The total time used to parse each sentence is given in seconds.
