 cannot classify are treated as discourse-new, the agreement between the system and the three subjects that annotated this corpus on the two classes first-mention (= discourse-old) and subsequent-mention (= discourse-new or bridges) is K = 0.7; this should be compared with an agreement of K = 0.77 between the three annotators themselves.
    If, instead of counting these definite descriptions as discourse-new, we simply do not include them in our measure of agreement, then the agreement between the system and the annotators is K = 0.78, as opposed to K = 0.81 between the annotators.
    (Notice that the fact that the agreement between annotators goes up, as well, indicates that the definite descriptions that the system can't handle are &amp;quot;harder&amp;quot; than the rest.)
    Version 2 finds a classification for 355 out of 464 definite descriptions; however, its agreement figures are worse.
    If we count the cases that the system can't classify as discourse-new, the agreement between the system and th
