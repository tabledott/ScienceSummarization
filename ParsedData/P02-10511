   This translation problem is especially challenging because new phrases can appear from nowhere, and because many named-entities are domain specific, not to be found in bilingual dictionaries.
    A system that specializes in translating named entities such as the one we describe here would be an important tool for many NLP applications.
    Statistical machine translation systems can use such a system as a component to handle phrase translation in order to improve overall translation quality.
    CrossLingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems could identify relevant documents based on translations of named entity phrases provided by such a system.
    Question Answering (QA) systems could benefit substantially from such a tool since the answer to many factoid questions involve named entities (e.g., answers to who questions usually involve Persons/Organizations, where questions involve Locations, and when questions involve Temporal Expressions).
