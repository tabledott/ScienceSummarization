    Materials consisted of individually randomized lists of 119 target and filler verbs taken from Levin's (1993) electronic index, as above.

    To avoid unwanted priming of target items, the 60 fillers were automatically selected from the set of verbs that do not share any class with any of the senses of the 59 target verbs in Levin's index.
    In this task, if we take only the target items into account, the experts agreed 74.6% of the time (K = 0.64) with each other, and 86% (K --= 0.80) and 69% (K =--- 0.57) with the gold standard.
    (If we take all the verbs into consideration, they agreed in 67% of the cases [K =- 0.561 with each othe
