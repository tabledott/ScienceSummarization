   Pearson&#8217;s correlation measures the and direction of a between any two variables, i.e. automatic metric score and human assigned mean coverage score in our case.
    It ranges from +1 to -1.
    A correlation of 1 means that there is a perfect positive linear relationship between the two variables, a correlation of -1 means that there is a perfect negative linear relationship between them, and a correlation of 0 means that there is no linear relationship between them.
    Since we would like to use automatic evaluation metric not only in comparing systems a quick overview of the Pearson&#8217;s coefficient, see: http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/A34739.html. but also in in-house system development, a good linear correlation with human judgment would enable us to use automatic scores to predict corresponding human judgment scores.
    Therefore, Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient is a good measure to look at. correlation coefficient 6is also a measure of correlation between two variables.
    It is
