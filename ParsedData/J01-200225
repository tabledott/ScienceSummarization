) indeed results in better performance.
    On the other hand, the increased amount of data also increases time and space requirements for some systems to such a degree that we had to exclude them from (some parts of) the experiments.
    The data in the training set is the only information used in tagger and combiner construction: all components of all taggers and combiners (lexicon, context statistics, etc.) are entirely data driven, and no manual adjustments are made.
    If any tagger or combiner construction method is parametrized, we use default settings where available.
    If there is no default, we choose intuitively appropriate values without preliminary testing.
    In these cases, we report such parameter settings in the introduction to the system.
    In the current experiments we make use of three corpora.
    The first is the LOB corpus (Johansson 1986), which we used in the earlier experiments as well (van Halteren, Zavrel, and Daelemans 1998) and which has proved to be a good testing ground.
