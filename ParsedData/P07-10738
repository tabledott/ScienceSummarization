For any instance x E X from a bag X E X, let &#966;(x) be the (implicit) feature vector representation of x.
    Then the corresponding SVM optimization problem can be formulated as in Figure 2: minimize: The capacity control parameter C is normalized by the total number of instances L = Lp + Ln = EXEXp |X |+ EXEXn |X|, so that it remains independent of the size of the dataset.
    The additional non-negative parameter cp (cn = 1&#8722;cp) controls the relative influence that false negative vs. false positive errors have on the value of the objective function.
    Because not all instances from positive bags are real positive instances, it makes sense to have false negative errors be penalized less than false positive errors (i.e. cp &lt; 0.5).
    In the dual formulation of the optimization problem from Figure 2, bag instances appear only inside dot products of the form K(x1, x2) = &#966;(x1)&#966;(x2).
    The kernel K is instantiated to a subsequence kernel, as described in the next section.
