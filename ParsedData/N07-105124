e boundaries and results in state of the art performance for Chinese and German.
    On English, the parser is outperformed only by the reranking parser of Charniak and Johnson (2005), which has access to a variety of features which cannot be captured by a generative model.
    Space does not permit a thorough exposition of our analysis, but as in the case of English (Petrov et al., 2006), the learned subcategories exhibit interesting linguistic interpretations.
    In German, for example, the model learns subcategories for different cases and genders.
    Related to cross language generalization is the generalization across domains for the same language.
    It is well known that a model trained on the Wall Street Journal loses significantly in performance when evaluated on the Brown Corpus (see Gildea (2001) for more details and the exact setup of their experiment, which we duplicated here).
    Recently McClosky et al. (2006) came to the conclusion that this performance drop is not due to overfitting the W
