 we will normalize the conditional probabilities P(Si|Si&#8722;1) by the number feature of pairs that form the Cartesian product over Si and Si&#8722;1.
  
  
    The model in Section 2.1 was trained on the BLLIP corpus (30 M words), a collection of texts from the Wall Street Journal (years 1987-89).
    The corpus contains 98,732 stories.
    The average story length is 19.2 sentences.
    71.30% of the texts in the corpus are less than 50 sentences long.
    An example of the texts in this newswire corpus is shown in Figure 3.
    The corpus is distributed in a Treebankstyle machine-parsed version which was produced with Charniak&#8217;s (2000) parser.
    The parser is a &#8220;maximum-entropy inspired&#8221; probabilistic generative model.
    It achieves 90.1% average precision/recall for sentences with maximum length 40 and 89.5% for sentences with maximum length 100 when trained and tested on the standard sections of the Wall Street Journal Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
    We also obtained a depende
