ammar.
    Subsequently, the constituents of each sentence-pair are matched according to some heuristic procedure.
    A number of recent proposals can be cast in this framework (Sadler and Vendelmans 1990; Kaji, Kida, and Morimoto 1992; Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993; Cranias, Papageorgiou, and Peperidis 1994; Grishman 1994).
    The parse-parse-match procedure is susceptible to three weaknesses: &#8226; The grammars may be incompatible across languages.
    The best-matching constituent types between the two languages may not include the same core arguments.
    While grammatical differences can make this problem unavoidable, there is often a degree of arbitrariness in a grammar's chosen set of syntactic categories, particularly if the grammar is designed to be robust.
    The mismatch can be exacerbated when the monolingual grammars are designed independently, or under different theoretical considerations. corpus, we mean a set of matchings between the constituents of the sentences.
