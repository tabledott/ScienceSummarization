preposition pa, ch, and combined models.
			The baseline in this task is 28.94% (using no preposition).
			Precision and recall numbers are shown in Table 6 and Table 7.
			From Table 7 it is evident that prepositions show a wide range of predictability.
			Prepositions such as than and about show high recall and precision, due to the lexical and morphosyntactic regularities that govern their distribution.
			At the low end, the semantically more independent prepositions since and at show much lower precision and recall numbers.
