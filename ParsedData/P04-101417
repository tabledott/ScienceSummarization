82,007 features and the dependency model has 984,522 features.
    We used 45 machines of a 64-node Beowulf cluster to estimate the dependency model, with an average memory usage of approximately 550 MB for each machine.
    For the normal-form model we were able to reduce the size of the charts considerably by applying two types of restriction to the parser: first, categories can only combine if they appear together in a rule instantiation in sections 2&#8211;21 of CCGbank; and second, we apply the normal-form restrictions described in Eisner (1996).
    (See Clark and Curran (2004) for a description of the Eisner constraints.)
    The normal-form model requires only 5 machines for estimation, with an average memory usage of 730 MB for each machine.
    Initially we tried the parallel version of GIS described in Clark and Curran (2003) to perform the estimation, running over the Beowulf cluster.
    However, we found that GIS converged extremely slowly; this is in line with other recent results in the litera
