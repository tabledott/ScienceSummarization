 in Figure 1.
    Why does this happen?
    It turns out that in translation hypotheses that move &#8220;X said&#8221; or &#8220;X asked&#8221; away from the beginning of the sentence, more commas appear, and fewer S-C and SBAR-C nodes appear.
    Therefore, the new features work to discourage these hypotheses.
    Example 6 shows additionally that commas next to speaking verbs are now correctly deleted.
    Examples 7&#8211;8 in Figure 1 show other kinds of unanticipated improvements.
    We do not have space for a fuller analysis, but we note that the specific effects we describe above account for only part of the overall B1.Eu improvement.
    In Table 6 are shown feature weights learned for the word-context features.
    A surprising number of the highest-weighted features have to do with translations of dates and bylines.
    Many of the penalties seem to discourage spurious insertion or deletion of frequent words (for, &#8217;s, said, parentheses, and quotes).
    Finally, we note that several of the fe
