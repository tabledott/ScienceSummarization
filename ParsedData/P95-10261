, given a few seed collocations 'Note that the problem here is sense disambiguation: assigning each instance of a word to established sense definitions (such as in a dictionary).
    This differs from sense induction: using distributional similarity to partition word instances into clusters that may have no relation to standard sense partitions.
    'Here I use the traditional dictionary definition of collocation &#8212; &amp;quot;appearing in the same location; a juxtaposition of words&amp;quot;.
    No idiomatic or non-compositional interpretation is implied. for each sense, This procedure is robust and selfcorrecting, and exhibits many strengths of supervised approaches, including sensitivity to word-order information lost in earlier unsupervised algorithms.
  
  
    The observation that words strongly tend to exhibit only one sense in a given discourse or document was stated and quantified in Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992).
    Yet to date, the full power of this property has not been exploited for sen
