 form of a very small bootstrapping transliteration set.
  
  
    The algorithm can be naturally extended to comparable corpora of more than two languages.
    Pair-wise time sequence scoring and transliteration models should give better confidence in NE matches.
    The ultimate goal of this work is to automatically tag NEs so that they can be used for training of an NER system for a new language.
    To this end, we would like to compare the performance of an NER system trained on a corpus tagged using this approach to one trained on a hand-tagged corpus.
