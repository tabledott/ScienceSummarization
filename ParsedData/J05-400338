d, and added the resulting data to the training corpus.
    The resulting BLEU scores were practically the same as the baseline; thus, our classifier does indeed help to discover higher-quality parallel data.
    We also measured the MT performance impact of the extracted corpora described in Section 4.2.
    We trained a Baseline MT system on all our available (in-domain and MT performance improvements for Arabic-English. out-of-domain) parallel data, and a PlusExtracted system on the parallel data plus the extracted in-domain data.
    Clearly, we have access to no UpperBound system in this case.
    The results are presented in the first two rows of Table 7.
    Adding the extracted corpus lowers the score for the Arabic-English system and improves the score for the Chinese-English one; however, none of the differences are statistically significant.
    Since the baseline systems are trained on such large amounts of data (see Section 4.2), it is not surprising that our extracted corpora have no significant
