ormulation of the speech recognition problem, the most probable part-of-speech sequence, 15, is given by: In theory, with the proper choice for the probability distributions Pr(P) and Pr(W I P), this algorithm will perform as well as, or better than, any possible alternative that one could imagine.
    Unfortunately, the probability distributions Pr(P) and Pr(W P) are enormously complex: Pr(W I P) is a table giving for every pair W and P of the same length a number between 0 and 1 that is the probability that a sequence of words chosen at random from English text and found to have the part-of-speech sequence P will turn out to be the word sequence W. Changing even a single word or part-of-speech in a long sequence may change this number by many orders of magnitude.
    However, experience has shown that surprisingly high tagging accuracy can be achieved in practice using very simple approximations to Pr(P) and Pr(W I P).
    In particular, it is possible to replace Pr(P) by a trigram approximation: and to rep
