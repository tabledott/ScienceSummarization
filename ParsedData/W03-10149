have different connotations.
    For example, you can say that a comedian bombed last night, which is a subjective statement, but you can&#8217;t express this sentiment with the passive voice of bombed.
    In Section 3.2, we will show examples of extraction patterns representing subjective expressions which do in fact exhibit both of these phenomena.
    A variety of algorithms have been developed to automatically learn extraction patterns.
    Most of these algorithms require special training resources, such as texts annotated with domain-specific tags (e.g., AutoSlog (Riloff, 1993), CRYSTAL (Soderland et al., 1995), RAPIER (Califf, 1998), SRV (Freitag, 1998), WHISK (Soderland, 1999)) or manually defined keywords, frames, or object recognizers (e.g., PALKA (Kim and Moldovan, 1993) and LIEP (Huffman, 1996)).
    AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1996) takes a different approach, requiring only a corpus of unannotated texts that have been separated into those that are related to the target domain (the &#8220;relevant&#822
