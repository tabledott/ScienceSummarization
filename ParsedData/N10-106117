nistic syntactic configuration (appositives or predicative nominatives constructions).6 The {ri} factors are heuristically set to place most of their mass on the closest antecedent by tree distance.
    During training, we proceed in stages, each consisting of 5 iterations: We evaluate our system at the end of stage using the B3All metric on the A05CU development set (see Section 5 for details).
  
  
    We considered the challenging end-to-end system mention setting, where in addition to predicting mention partitions, a system must identify the mentions themselves and their boundaries automatically.
    Our system deterministically extracts mention boundaries from parse trees (Section 5.2).
    We utilized no coreference annotation during training, but did use minimal prototype information to prime the learning of entity types (Section 5.3).
    For evaluation, we used standard coreference data sets derived from the ACE corpora: For all experiments, we evaluated on the dev and test sets above.
    To train,
