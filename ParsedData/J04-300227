rather than individual items?
    Many good clues of subjectivity occur with low frequency (Wiebe, McKeever, and Bruce 1998).
    In fact, as we shall see below, uniqueness in the corpus is an informative feature for subjectivity classification.
    Thus, we do not want to discard low-frequency clues, because they are a valuable source of information, and we do not want to evaluate individual low-frequency lexical items, because the results would be unreliable.
    Our strategy is thus to identify and evaluate sets of words and phrases, rather than individual items.
    What kinds of results may we expect?
    We cannot expect absolutely high precision with respect to the opinion piece classifications, even for strong clues, for three reasons.
    First, for our purposes, the data are noisy.
    As mentioned above, while the proportion of subjective sentences is higher in opinion than in nonopinion pieces, the proportions are not 100 and 0: Opinion pieces contain objective sentences, and nonopinion pieces con
