  While the difference between the (absolute) values of the highest and lowest correlation coefficients in the ?M&amp;C?
  column of Table 3 is of the order of 0.1, all of the coefficients compare quite favorably with this estimate of the upper bound; furthermore, the difference diminishes almost twofold as we consider the larger Rubenstein?Goodenough dataset (column ?R&amp;G?
  of Table 3).10 In fact, the measures are divided in their reaction to increasing the size of the dataset: the correlations of relHS, simLC, and simR improve but those of distJC and simL deteriorate.
  This division might not be arbitrary: the last two depend on the same three quantities, log p(c1), log p(c2), and log p(lso(c1, c2)) (see equations (16) and (20)).
