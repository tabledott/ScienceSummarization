better by using the automatic data only in cases where no training data are available, backing off to the distribution Panto from Ptrai,,,.
    The fourth row of Table 12 shows results with Panto incorporated into the backoff lattice of all the features of Figure 7, which actually resulted in a slight decrease in performance from the system without the bootstrapped data, shown in the third row.
    This is presumably because, although the system trained on automatically labeled data performed with reasonable accuracy, many of the cases it classifies correctly overlap with the training data.
    In fact our backing-off estimate of P(r h, pt, t) classifies correctly only 66% of the additional cases that it covers over Ptrain(r h, pt, t).
    The three methods of generalizing lexical statistics each had roughly equivalent accuracy on cases for which they were able to derive an estimate of the role probabilities for unseen head words.
    The differences between the three were primarily due to how much they could
