    We evaluated the word token f-score of the most frequent marginal word segmentation, and compared that to average of the word token f-score for the 800 samples, which is also reported in Table 1.
    For each grammar and setting we tried, the maximum marginal segmentation was better than the sample average, sometimes by a large margin.
    Given its simplicity, this suggests that maximum marginal
