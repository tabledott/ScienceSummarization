ength prediction by characters (features 3 to 5) showed strong influence on the accuracy, while word bigrams (feature 2) and special characters in them (features 11 and 12) showed comparatively weak influence.
    Four training and testing corpora were used in the first bakeoff (Sproat and Emerson, 2003), including the Academia Sinica Corpus (AS), the Penn Chinese Treebank Corpus (CTB), the Hong Kong City University Corpus (CU) and the Peking University Corpus (PU).
    However, because the testing data from the Penn Chinese Treebank Corpus is currently unavailable, we excluded this corpus.
    The corpora are encoded in GB (PU, CTB) and BIG5 (AS, CU).
    In order to test them consistently in our system, they are all converted to UTF8 without loss of information.
    The results are shown in Table 5.
    We follow the format from Peng et al. (2004).
    Each row represents a CWS model.
    The first eight rows represent models from Sproat and Emerson (2003) that participated in at least one closed test from
