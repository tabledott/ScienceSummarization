e string fJ1 and a target language string eI1.
    In (statistical) alignment models Pr(fJ1,aJ1  |eI1), a &#8220;hidden&#8221; alignment aJ1 is introduced that describes a mapping from a source position j to a target position aj.
    The relationship between the translation model and the alignment model is given by The alignment aJ 1 may contain alignments aj = 0 with the empty word e0 to account for source words that are not aligned with any target word.
    In general, the statistical model depends on a set of unknown parameters &#952; that is learned from training data.
    To express the dependence of the model on the parameter set, we use the following notation: The art of statistical modeling is to develop specific statistical models that capture the relevant properties of the considered problem domain.
    In our case, the statistical alignment model has to describe the relationship between a source language string and a target language string adequately.
    To train the unknown parameters &#952;, we
