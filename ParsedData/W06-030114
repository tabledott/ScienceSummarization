 some Event&#8221;).
    Among these FEs, we can consider that Experiencer can be a holder and Focal_participant can be a topic (if any exists in a sentence).
    We manually built a mapping table to map FEs to holder or topic using as support the FE definitions in each opinion related frame and the annotated sample sentences.
  
  
    The goal of our experiment is first, to see how our holder and topic labeling system works on the FrameNet data, and second, to examine how it performs on online news media text.
    The first data set (Testset 1) consists of 10% of data described in Subsection 3.2 and the second (Testset 2) is manually annotated by 2 humans.
    (see Subsection 4.2).
    We report experimental results for both test sets.
    Gold Standard: In total, Testset 1 contains 2028 annotated sentences collected from FrameNet data set.
    (834 from frames related to opinion verb and 1194 from opinion adjectives) We measure the system performance using precision (the percentage of correct holders/topic
