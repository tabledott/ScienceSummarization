eshold on the test set (the remaining 293 pairs).
    These are compared to r. scores of the STRAND system (with original, untuned parameters), on the same test set, in Table 3.
    In every case, the tsim classifier agreed more strongly with the human evaluations, and its F score is higher than that of STRAND.
    Figure 5 shows r. and the F measure plotted against T. In this application, the content-based classifier (at its approximate best performance, thresholding at 0.44) complements the structural classifier&#8217;s high precision.
    Given two high-performing methods that use orthogonal information for identifying good candidate pairs (one using only structure, the other using only content), the natural question is whether the techniques can be combined for even better performance.
    We repeated the experiment presented in Section 2.2.3, adding the tsim score as a feature.
    The same cross-validation setup was used, with the same division into folds.
