d missed entirely, and 68 entities were lost.
    We tested the statistical significance of the gains (of all the data combined) using the same sentence-level, stratified shuffling technique as Bikel&#8217;s parse comparator and found that both precision and recall gains were significant at p &lt; 10&#8722;4.
    An example from the data where the joint model helped improve both parse structure and named entity recognition is shown in Figure 4.
    The output from the individual models is shown in part (a), with the output from the named entity recognizer shown in brackets on the words at leaves of the parse.
    The output from the joint model is shown in part (b), with the named entity information encoded within the parse.
    In this example, the named entity Egyptian Islamic Jihad helped the parser to get its surrounding context correct, because it is improbable to attach a PP headed by with to an organization.
    At the same time, the surrounding context helped the joint model correctly identify Egyptia
