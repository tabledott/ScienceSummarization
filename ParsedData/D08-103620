 data sets all of the Bayesian estimators strongly outperform EM (and, to a lesser extent, VB) with respect to all of our evaluation measures, confirming the results reported in Goldwater and Griffiths (2007).
    This is perhaps not too surprising, as the Bayesian prior plays a comparatively stronger role with a smaller training corpus (which makes the likelihood term smaller) and the approximation used by Variational Bayes is likely to be less accurate on smaller data sets.
    But on larger data sets, which Goldwater et al did not study, the results are much less clear, and depend on which evaluation measure is used.
    Expectation Maximization does surprisingly well on larger data sets and is competitive with the Bayesian estimators at least in terms of cross-validation accuracy, confirming the results reported by Johnson (2007).
    Variational Bayes converges faster than all of the other estimators we examined here.
    We found that the speed of convergence of our samplers depends to a large degree up
