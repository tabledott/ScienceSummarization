examples positive features and the rest negative features.
			We counted 5.8 timesmore access to negative features than positive fea tures.We now look more into the implementation details of the used hash table to answer the pre viously asked question.
			The hash table for the feature?index mapping uses three arrays: one for the keys, one for the values and a status array to indicate the deleted elements.
			If a program storesa value then the hash function uses the key to cal culate the location of the value.
			Since the hashfunction is a heuristic function, the predicted lo cation might be wrong, which leads to so-called 2We use the hash tables of the trove library: http://sourceforge.net/projects/trove4j.
			hash misses.
			In such cases the hash algorithm has to retry to find the value.
			We counted 87% hash misses including misses where the hash had to retry several times.
			The number of hash misseswas high, because of the additional negative fea tures.
			The CPU cache can only store a small amount
