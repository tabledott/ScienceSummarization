e specific to the domain and seem peculiar when viewed in a more general context.
    For example, we have already mentioned that Mr. Speaker was translated as Monsieur le Pr&#233;sident, which is obviously only valid for this domain.
    Canadian family is another example; it is often translated as famille (the Canadian qualifier is dropped in the French version).
    This is an important feature of the system, since in this way the sublanguage of the domain is employed for the translation.
    However, many of the collocations that Champollion identifies are general, domain-independent ones.
    Champollion cannot make any distinction between domain-specific and general collocations.
    What is clearly needed is a way to determine the generality of each produced translation, as many translations found by Champollion are of general use and could be directly applied to other domains.
    This may be possible by intersecting the output of Champollion on corpora from many different domains.
