en out of 215 detected CSs satisfied the conditions for a strong CS.
    One strong CS was an incorrectly detected CS, and this problem is mentioned in the following section.
    For two of the ten correctly detected strong CSs, the omitted components that depend on one of the bunsetsus a: The number of sentences that were classified into this category. b: The number of sentences in which all the CSs were detected correctly. c: The number of sentences whose whole dependency structures were analyzed correctly. in the post-conjunct other than the EB (the case of Figure 14d) were recovered correctly.
    There was no modifier ellipsis of this type that could not be found by our method in the test sentences.
    Other strong CSs had omitted modifiers depending on the EB (the case of Figure 14c), or had no omitted modifiers.
    &#8226; There were two incomplete conjunctive structures in the test sentences.
    Both of them were found by our method, and the omitted predicates concerning them were recovered correct
