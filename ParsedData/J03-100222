 the first-order alignment model in the HMM lies in the fact that here we now have a dependence along the j-axis instead of a dependence along the i-axis.
    The model p=1(&#8710;j  |&#183; &#183; &#183;) is used to position the first word of a set Bi, and the model p&gt;1(&#8710;j  |&#183; &#183; &#183;) is used to position the remaining words from left to right: The function i &#8594; i' = p(i) gives the largest value i' &lt; i for which |Bi, |&gt; 0.
    The symbol BP(i) denotes the average of all elements in BP(i).
    Models 3, 4, and 5 define the probability p(B0  |BI1) as uniformly distributed for the O0! possibilities given the number of words aligned with the empty word O0 = |B0|.
    Assuming a binomial distribution for the number of words aligned with the empty word, we obtain the following distribution for B0: The free parameter p1 is associated with the number of words that are aligned with the empty word.
    There are O0! ways to order the O0 words produced by the empty word, and hence, the al
