    In this paper we have presented a particularly directed program of research for how text corpora can contribute to linguistics and computational linguistics.
    We first presented a representation language for lexical knowledge, the generative lexicon, and demonstrated how it facilitates the structuring of lexical relations among words, looking in particular at the problems of metonymy and polysemy.
    Such a framework for lexical knowledge suggests that there are richer relationships among words in text beyond that of simple co-occurrence that can be extracted automatically.
    The work suggests how linguistic phenomena such as metonymy and polysemy might be exploited for knowledge acquisition for lexical items.
    Unlike purely statistical collocational analyses, the framework of a semantic theory allows the automatic construction of predictions about deeper semantic relationships among words appearing in collocation
