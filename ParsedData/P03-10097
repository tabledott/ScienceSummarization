 citations were used per test verb.
    The lexicon was evaluated against manually analysed corpus data after an empirically defined threshold of 0.025 was set on relative frequencies of SCFs to remove noisy SCFs.
    The method yielded 71.8% precision and 34.5% recall.
    When we removed the filtering threshold, and evaluated the noisy distribution, F-measure4 dropped from 44.9 to 38.51.5
  
  
    Data clustering is a process which aims to partition a given set into subsets (clusters) of elements that are similar to one another, while ensuring that elements that are not similar are assigned to different clusters.
    We use clustering for partitioning a set of verbs.
    Our hypothesis is that information about SCFs and their associated frequencies is relevant for identifying semantically related verbs.
    Hence, we use SCFs as relevance features to guide the clustering process.6 comparing the probability of a randomly chosen pair of verbs verbi and verbj to share the same predominant sense (4.5%) with th
