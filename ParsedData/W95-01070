  Text Chunking Using Transformation-Based Learning
  
    Eric Brill introduced transformation-based learning and showed that it can do part-ofspeech tagging with fairly high accuracy.
    The same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive &amp;quot;baseNP&amp;quot; chunks.
    For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word.
    In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 92% for baseNP chunks and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence.
    Some interesting adaptations to the transformation-based learning approach are also suggested by this application.
  
  
    Text chunking involves dividing sentences into nonoverlapping segments on the basis of fairly superficial analysis.
    Abney (1991) has proposed this as a useful and relatively tr
