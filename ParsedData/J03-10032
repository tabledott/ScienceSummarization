tive allows us to solve a number of problems that have plagued earlier algorithms for the generation of referring expressions; and (4) the combined use of graphs and cost functions paves the way for an integration of rule-based generation techniques with more recent stochastic approaches.
  
  
    The generation of referring expressions is one of the most common tasks in natural language generation and has been addressed by many researchers in the past two decades, including Appelt (1985), Reiter (1990), Dale and Haddock (1991), Dale (1992), Dale and Reiter (1995), Horacek (1997), Stone and Webber (1998), Krahmer and Theune (1998, 2002), Bateman (1999), and van Deemter (2000, 2002).
    In this article, we present a general, graph-theoretic approach to the generation of referring expressions.
    We propose to formalize a scene (i.e., a domain of objects and their properties and relations) as a labeled directed graph and describe the content selection problem (which properties and relations to include in a d
