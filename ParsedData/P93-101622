programs from parse trees.
    Since programming languages are designed to be unambiguous, the attribution rules need to be evaluated on only one parse tree.
    In attribute grammar interpretation of GB theory, the principles are encoded in the attribution rules, and the phrase structure grammar is replaced by X-bar theory and Move-a.
    Therefore, a large number of structures will be constructed and evaluated by the attribution rules, thus leading to a serious overgeneration problem.
    For this reason, Correa pointed out that the attribute grammar interpretation should be used as a specification of an implementation, rather than an implementation itself.
  
  
    Abney and Cole (1986) presented a GB parser that uses actors (Agha, 1986).
    Actors are similar to objects in having internal states and responding to messages.
    In our model, each syntactic category is represented by an object.
    In (Abney and Cole, 1986), each instance of a category is represented by an actor.
    The actors build stru
