    There are striking differences between the Spearman and Pearson correlations for other metrics, in particular the CDER metric (Leusch et al., 2006) had the second highest rank in Spearman correlations (after TERp), but was the sixth ranked metric according to the Pearson correlation.
    In several cases, TERp was not the best metric (if a metric was the best in all conditions, its average rank would be 1), although it performed well on average.
    In particular, TERp did significantly better than the TER metric, indicating the benefit of the enhancements made to TER.
  
  
    TERp uses probabilistic phrasal substitutions to align phrases in the hypothesis with phrases in the reference.
    It does so by looking up&#8212;in a precomputed phrase table&#8212;paraphrases of phrases in the reference and using its associated edit cost as the cost of performing a match against the hypothesis.
    The paraphrases used in TERp were extracted using the pivot-based method as described in (Bannard and Callis
