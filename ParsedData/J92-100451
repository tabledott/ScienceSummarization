ile designing the grammar, nor have we yet looked at those sentences that failed to parse.
    However, we decided to examine the parse trees for those sentences that produced at least one parse to determine the depth of the first reasonable parse.
    The results were essentially the same for the training and the test sentences, as shown in Table 2.
    Both gave a reasonable parse as either the first or second proposed parse 96% of the time.
    Two of the test sentences never gave a correct parse.
    We have recently developed a subdomain for TINA that has been incorporated into a complete spoken language system called VOYAGER.
    The system provides directions on how to get from one place to another within an urban region, and also gives information such as phone number or address for places such as restaurants, hotels, libraries, etc.
    We have made extensive use of semantic filters within this domain, in order to reduce the perplexity of the recognition task as much as possible.
