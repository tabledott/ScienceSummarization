an be analysed hierarchically in terms of relations between text spans.
    Much work in NLG makes the assumption that constructing something like an RS tree is a necessary step in the planning of a text.
    This work takes as its starting point Marcu's [Marcu 97] excellent formalisation of RST and the problem of building legal RST trees, and for the purposes of this paper the phrase &amp;quot;text planning&amp;quot; will generally denote the task characterised by him.
    In this task, one is given a set of facts all of which should be included in a text and a set of relations between facts, some of which can be included in the text.
    The task is to produce a legal RS tree using the facts and some relations (oi. the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; such tree).
    Following the original work on RST and assumptions that have been commonly made in subsequent work, we will assume that there is a fixed set of possible relations (we include &amp;quot;joint&amp;quot; as a second-class relation which can be applied to
