 current WSD work, it is not clear that this distinction is meaningful.
    It may be more useful to regard the two as lying along a continuum, and to consider the role 3.1.3 Domain.
    The use of domain for WSD is first evident in the microglossaries developed in early MT work (see Section 2.1).
    The notion of disambiguating senses based on domain is implicit in various AI-based approaches, such as Schank's script approach to natural language processing (Schank and Abelson 1977), which matched words to senses based on the context or &amp;quot;script&amp;quot; activated by the general topic of the discourse.
