 the Attack template.
    Arson also unexpectedly scored well.
    It only occurs in 40 documents overall, suggesting our algorithm works with little evidence.
    Per-template performace is good, and our .40 overall score from the previous section illustrates that we perform quite well in comparison to the .44.53 range of weakly and fully supervised results.
    These evaluations use the standard TST3 and TST4 test sets, including the documents that are not labeled with any templates.
    74 of the 200 test documents are unlabeled.
    In order to determine where the system&#8217;s false positives originate, we also measure performance only on the 126 test documents that have at least one template.
    Figure 7 presents the results on this subset.
    Kidnap improves most significantly in F1 score (7 F1 points absolute), but the others only change slightly.
    Most of the false positives in the system thus do not originate from the unlabeled documents (the 74 unlabeled), but rather from extracting incorrect
