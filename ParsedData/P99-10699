Metropolis acceptancerejection method to adjust the distribution of this stream of feature structures to achieve detailed balance, which then produces a stream of feature structures distributed according to Pei (w).
    While this scheme is theoretically sound, it would appear to be computationally impractical for realistic SUBGs.
    Every step of the proposed procedure (corresponding to a single step of gradient ascent) requires a very large number of PCFG samples: samples must be found that correspond to well-formed SUBGs; many such samples are required to bring the Metropolis algorithm to (near) equilibrium; many samples are needed at equilibrium to properly estimate E(f3).
    The idea of a gradient ascent of the likelihood (2) is appealing&#8212;a simple calculation reveals that the likelihood is concave and therefore free of local maxima.
    But the gradient (in particular, E9(f3)) is intractable.
    This motivates an alternative strategy involving a data-based estimate of E9(f3): where y(w) is the y
