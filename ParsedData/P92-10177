r inference, we give random initial values to the parameters Bp,q,&#8222; and Up,&#8222;, subject to the constraints (7).
    The intended meaning of rule probabilities in a SCFG is directly tied to the intuition of contextfreeness: a derivation is assigned a probability which is the product of the probabilities of the rules used in each step of the derivation.
    Contextfreeness together with the commutativity of multiplication thus allow us to identify all derivations associated to the same parse tree, and we will Up,,, where c = (w,B) and 4, = tvi speak indifferently below of derivation and analysis (parse tree) probabilities.
    Finally, the probability of a sentence or sentential form is the sum of the probabilities of all its analyses (equivalently, the sum of the probabilities of all of its leftmost derivations from the start symbol).
    The basic idea of the inside-outside algorithm is to use the current rule probabilities and the training set W to estimate the expected frequencies of certain types
