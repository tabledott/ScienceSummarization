. table 1), a result that outperforms Hirschberg and Litman's (1993).
    The same algorithm identified correctly 81.3% of the clause boundaries, with a precision of 90.3% (see table 2).
    We are not aware of any surface-form-based algorithms that achieve similar results.
  
  
    The rhetorical parsing algorithm is outlined in figure 2.
    In the first step, the marker and clause identification algorithm is applied.
    Once the textual units are determined, the rhetorical parser uses the procedures derived from the corpus analysis to hypothesize rhetorical relations between the textual units.
    A constraint-satisfaction procedure similar to that described in (Marcu, 1996) then determines all the valid discourse trees (see (Marcu, 1997) for details).
    The rhetorical parsing algorithm has been fully implemented in C++.
    Discourse is ambiguous the same way sentences are: more than one discourse structure is usually produced for a text.
    In our experiments, we noticed, at least for English, that
