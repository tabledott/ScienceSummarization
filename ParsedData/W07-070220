			Dutch-English models with and without a lexi calised reordering model.In Table 5 we can see that lexicalised reordering improves translation performance for both models.
			However, the improvement that was seen us ing CCG supertags without lexicalised reordering, almost disappears when using a stronger reorderingmodel.
			This suggests that CCG supertags?
			contribution is similar to that of a reordering model.
			The lex icalised reordering model only learns the orientation of a phrase with relation to its adjacent phrase, so its influence is very limited in range.
			If it can replace CCG supertags, it suggests that supertags?
			influence is also within a local range.
