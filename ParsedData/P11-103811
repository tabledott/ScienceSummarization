s, it does not shed any light on the relative similarity in the makeup of OOV tokens in each case.
    To further analyse the two data sources, we extracted the set of OOV terms found exclusively in SMS and Twitter, and analysed each.
    Manual analysis of the two sets revealed that most OOV words found only in SMS were personal names.
    The Twitter-specific set, on the other hand, contained a heterogeneous collection of ill-formed words and proper nouns.
    This suggests that Twitter is a richer/noisier data source, and that text normalisation for Twitter needs to be more nuanced than for SMS.
    To further analyse the ill-formed words in Twitter, we randomly selected 449 tweets and manually analysed the sources of lexical variation, to determine the phenomena that lexical normalisation needs to deal with.
    We identified 254 token instances of lexical normalisation, and broke them down into categories, as listed in Table 1.
    &#8220;Letter&#8221; refers to instances where letters are missing or the
