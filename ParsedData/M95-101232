and CEO" retired-ttl(grp-13)  "retired " To shift the scope of "retired" from the overall coordination to individual titles, the following rule applies .

  Additionally, these kinds of distribution rules further contribute to collating facts relevant to template generation onto the individuals for which these facts hold .
