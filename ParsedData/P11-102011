  To ensure the quality of the annotations being produced, we used a two-tiered payment system.
    The idea was to reward workers who had shown the ability to write quality descriptions and the willingness to work on our tasks consistently.
    While everyone had access to the Tier-1 tasks, only workers who had been manually qualified could work on the Tier-2 tasks.
    The tasks were identical in the two tiers but each Tier-1 task only paid 1 cent while each Tier-2 task paid 5 cents, giving the workers a strong incentive to earn the qualification.
    The qualification process was done manually by the authors.
    We periodically evaluated the workers who had submitted the most Tier-1 tasks (usually on the order of few hundred submissions) and granted them access to the Tier-2 tasks if they had performed well.
    We assessed their work mainly on the grammaticality and spelling accuracy of the submitted descriptions.
    Since we had hundreds of submissions to base our decisions on, it was fairly easy to id
