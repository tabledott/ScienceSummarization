ty is feasible, and that both cross-lingual strategies are robust.
    The results for WordSim353 show that WN30g is the best for this dataset, with the rest of the methods falling over 10 percentage points relative to the monolingual experiment.
    A closer look at the WordNet results showed that most of the drop in performance was caused by out-of-vocabulary words, due to the smaller vocabulary of the Spanish WordNet.
    Though not totally comparable, if we compute the correlation over pairs covered in WordNet alone, the correlation would drop only 2 percentage points.
    In the case of the distributional approaches, the fall in performance was caused by the translations, as only 61% of the words were translated into the original word in the English datasets.
  
  
    In this section we present some analysis, including learning curves for distributional methods, the use of distributional similarity to improve WordNet similarity, the contrast between similarity and relatedness, and the combination of met
