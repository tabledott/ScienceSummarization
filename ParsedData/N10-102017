hing parameters are set using grid search on a development set.
    When performing inference with Gibbs Sampling, we use 1,000 samples for burn-in and take 10 samples at a lag of 100.
    Although using multiple samples introduces the possibility of poor results due to &#8220;act drift&#8221;, we found this not to be a problem in practice; in fact, taking multiple samples substantially improved performance during development.
    Recall that we infer hyperparameters using slice sampling.
    The concentration parameters chosen in this manner were always sparse (&lt; 1), which produced a moderate improvement over an uninformed prior.
    We are quite interested in what our models can tell us about how people converse on Twitter.
    To visualize and interpret our competing models, we examined act-emission distributions, posts with highconfidence acts, and act-transition diagrams.
    Of the three competing systems, we found the Conversation+Topic model by far the easiest to interpret: the 10-act model has 8 a
