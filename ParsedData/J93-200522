 all nominal forms.
    (cf.
    Cowie, Guthrie, and Pustejovsky [1992] for details of this operation on LDOCE.
    ):&amp;quot; In a related set of experiments performed while constructing a large lexical database for data extraction purposes, we seeded a lexicon with 6000 verbs from LDOCE.
    This process and the corpus tuning for both argument typing and subcategorization acquisition are described in Cowie, Guthrie, and Pustejovsky (1992) and Pustejovsky et al. (1992).
    In summary, based on a theory of lexical semantics, we have discussed how an MRD can be useful as a corpus for automatically seeding lexical structures.
    Rather than addressing the specific problems inherent in converting MRDs into useful lexicons, we have emphasized how it provides us, in a sense, with a generic vocabulary from which to begin lexical acquisition over corpora.
    In the next section, we will address the problem of taking these initial, and often very incomplete lexical structures, and enriching them with information
