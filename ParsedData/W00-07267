    The UCP chunk is reminiscent of the UCP (unlike coordinated phrase) constituent in the Treebank.
    Arguably, the conjunction is the head of the UCP, so most UCP chunks consist of conjunctions like and and or.
    UCPs are the rarest chunks and are probably not very useful for other NLP tasks.
    Tokens outside any chunk are mostly punctuation signs and the conjunctions in ordinary coordinated phrases.
    The word not may also be outside of any chunk.
    This happens in two cases: Either not is not inside the VP constituent in the Treebank annotation e.g. in ... (VP have (VP told (NP-1 clients) (S (NP-SBJ *-1) not (VP to (VP ship (NP anything)))))) or not is not followed by another verb (because the main verb is a form of to be).
    As the right chunk boundary is defined by the chunk's head, i.e. the main verb in this case, not is then in fact a postmodifier and as such not included in the chunk: &amp;quot;... [SBAR that ] [NP there ] [vp were ] n't [NP any major problems] .&amp;quot; All chunks
