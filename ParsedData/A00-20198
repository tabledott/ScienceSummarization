umption of independence, as shown below: Here, P(AB) is the probability of the occurrence of the AB bigram, estimated from its frequency in the general corpus, and P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of the first and second elements of the bigram, also estimated from the general corpus.
    Ungrammatical sequences should produce bigram probabilities that are much smaller than the product of the unigram probabilities (the value of MI will be negative).
    Trigram sequences are also used, but in this case the mutual information computation compares the co-occurrence of ABC to a model in which A and C are assumed to be conditionally independent given B (see Lin, 1998).
    Once again, a negative value is often indicative of a sequence that violates a rule of English.
    ALEK also uses mutual information to compare the distributions of tags and function words in the word-specific corpus to the distributions that are expected based on the general corpus.
    The measures for bigrams and trigrams are similar to t
