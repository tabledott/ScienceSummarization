tep in the exploration of this hypothesis is to determine which linguistic knowledge sources are most useful and whether their combination leads to improved results.
    We present a sense tagger which uses several knowledge sources.
    Tested accuracy exceeds 94% on our evaluation corpus.
    Our system attempts to disambiguate all content words in running text rather than limiting itself to treating a restricted vocabulary of words.
    It is argued that this approach is more likely to assist the creation of practical systems.
  
  
    Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a problem long recognised in computational linguistics (Yngve 1955) and there has been a recent resurgence of interest, including a special issue of this journal devoted to the topic (Ide and Veronis 1998).
    Despite this there is still a considerable diversity of methods employed by researchers, as well as differences in the definition of the problems to be tackled.
    The SENSEVAL evaluation framework (Kilgarriff 1998) was a DARPA-sty
