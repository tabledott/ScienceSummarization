   Applying transformational learning to text chunking requires that the system's current hypotheses about chunk structure be represented in a way that can be matched against the pattern parts of rules.
    One way to do this would be to have patterns match tree fragments and actions modify tree geometries, as in Brill's transformational parser (1993a).
    In this work, we have found it convenient to do so by encoding the chunking using an additional set of tags, so that each word carries both a part-of-speech tag and also a &amp;quot;chunk tag&amp;quot; from which the chunk structure can be derived.
    In the baseNP experiments aimed at non-recursive NP structures, we use the chunk tag set {I, 0, B}, where words marked I are inside some baseNP, those marked 0 are outside, and the B tag is used to mark the left most item of a baseNP which immediately follows another baseNP.
    In these tests, punctuation marks were tagged in the same way as words.
