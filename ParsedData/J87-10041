nt English grammars and sentences, timings indicate a fiveto tenfold speed advantage over Earley's context-free parsing algorithm. algorithm parses a sentence strictly from left to right that is, starts parsing as soon as the user types in the first word of a sentence, without waiting for completion of the sentence.
    A practical on-line parser based on the algorithm has been implemented in Common Lisp, and running on Symbolics and HP Al workstations.
    The parser is used in the multi-lingual machine translation project at CMU.
    Also, a commercial on-line parser for Japanese language is being built by Intelligent Technology Incorporation, on the technique developed at
  
  
    An efficient parsing algorithm for augmented context-free grammars is introduced, and its application to on-line natural language interfaces discussed.
    The algorithm is a generalized LR parsing algorithm, which precomputes an LR shift-reduce parsing table (possibly with multiple entries) from a given augmented context-free g
