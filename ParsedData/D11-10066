parser takes a tokenized input sentence (optionally part-ofspeech tagged) and produces a connected tree where directed arcs represent a syntactic head-modifier relationship.
    An example of such a tree is given in Figure 1.
    Dependency tree arcs are often labeled with the role of the syntactic relationship, e.g., is to hearing might be labeled as SUBJECT.
    However, we focus on unlabeled parsing in order to reduce problems that arise due to different treebank annotation schemes.
    Of course, even for unlabeled dependencies, significant variations in the annotation schemes remain.
    For example, in the Danish treebank determiners govern adjectives and nouns in noun phrases, while in most other treebanks the noun is the head of the noun phrase.
    Unlike previous work (Zeman and Resnik, 2008; Smith and Eisner, 2009), we do not apply any transformations to the treebanks, which makes our results easier to reproduce, but systematically underestimates accuracy.
