used a logical feature structure called GLARF proposed by Meyers et al. (2001a).
    A GLARF converter takes a syntactic tree as an input and augments it with several features.
    Figure 3 shows a sample GLARF structure obtained from the sentence &#8220;Katrina hit Louisiana&#8217;s coast.&#8221; We used GLARF for two reasons: first, unlike traditional constituent parsers, GLARF has an ability to regularize several linguistic phenomena such as participial constructions and coordination.
    This allows us to handle this syntactic variety in a uniform way.
    Second, an output structure can be easily converted into a directed graph that represents the relationship between each word, without losing significant information from the original sentence.
    Compared to an ordinary constituent tree, it is easier to extract syntactic relationships.
    In the next section, we discuss how we used this structure to generate basic patterns.
