ficantly with article length.
    For the eight articles of ten or fewer sentences, we paraphrased 60.8% of the sentences per article on average, but for longer articles only 9.3% of the sentences per article on average were paraphrased.
    Our analysis revealed that long articles tend to include large portions that are unique to the article, such as personal stories of the event participants, which explains why our algorithm had a lower paraphrasing rate for such articles.
    All 118 instances (59 per system) were presented in random order to two judges, who were asked to indicate whether the meaning had been preserved.
    Of the paraphrases generated by our system, the two evaluators deemed 81.4% and 78%, respectively, to be valid, whereas for the baseline system, the correctness results were 69.5% and 66.1%, respectively.
    Agreement according to the Kappa statistic was 0.6.
    Note that judging full sentences is inherently easier than judging templates, because template comparison requires consideri
