  Overview of Genia Event Task in BioNLP Shared Task 2011
  
    The Genia event task, a bio-molecular event extraction task, is arranged as one of the main tasks of BioNLP Shared Task 2011.
    As its second time to be arranged for community-wide focused efforts, it aimed to measure the advance of the community since 2009, and to evaluate generalization of the technology to full text papers.
    After a 3-month system development period, 15 teams submitted their performance results on test cases.
    The results show the community has made a significant advancement in terms of both performance improvement and generalization.
  
  
    The BioNLP Shared Task (BioNLP-ST, hereafter) is a series of efforts to promote a communitywide collaboration towards fine-grained information extraction (IE) in biomedical domain.
    The first event, BioNLP-ST 2009, introducing a biomolecular event (bio-event) extraction task to the community, attracted a wide attention, with 42 teams being registered for participation and 2
