ertain threshold t. Pseudo-projective parsing was proposed by Nivre and Nilsson (2005) as a way of dealing with non-projective structures in a projective data-driven parser.
    We projectivize training data by a minimal transformation, lifting non-projective arcs one step at a time, and extending the arc label of lifted arcs using the encoding scheme called HEAD by Nivre and Nilsson (2005), which means that a lifted arc is assigned the label rTh, where r is the original label and h is the label of the original head in the nonprojective dependency graph.
    Non-projective dependencies can be recovered by applying an inverse transformation to the output of the parser, using a left-to-right, top-down, breadthfirst search, guided by the extended arc labels rTh assigned by the parser.
    This technique has been used without exception for all languages.
  
  
    Since the projective parsing algorithm and graph transformation techniques are the same for all data sets, our optimization efforts have been focused o
