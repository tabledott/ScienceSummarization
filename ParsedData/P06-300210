 handle more words with reasonable computing time.
    Combination of partitionings 1 and 2 Now, we have two partitionings of two different, yet overlapping frequency bands.
    A large portion of these 8,000 words in the overlapping region is present in both partitionings.
    Again, we construct a graph, containing the clusters of both partitionings as nodes; weights of edges are the number of common elements, if at least two elements are shared.
    And again, CW is used to cluster this graph of clusters.
    This results in fewer clusters than before for the following reason: While the granularities of partitionings 1 and 2 are both high, they capture different aspects as they are obtained from different sources.
    Nodes of large clusters (which usually consist of open word classes) have many edges to the other partitioning&#8217;s nodes, which in turn connect to yet other clusters of the same word class.
    Eventually, these clusters can be grouped into one.
    Clusters that are not included in the g
