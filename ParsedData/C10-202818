			The purpose of our evaluation was to learn how well our framework can identify and distinguishbetween sentiment types defined by tags or smileys and to test if our framework can be successfully used to identify sentiment types in new un tagged sentences.
			5.1 Evaluation using cross-validation.
			In the first experiment we evaluated the consistency and quality of sentiment classification us ing cross-validation over the training set.
			Fullyautomated evaluation allowed us to test the performance of our algorithm under several dif ferent feature settings: Pn+W-M-Pt-, Pn+W+M-Pt-, Pn+W+M+Pt-, Pn-W-M-Pt+ and FULL, where +/?
			stands for utilization/omission of the followingfeature types: Pn:punctuation, W:Word, M:n grams (M stands for ?multi?), Pt:patterns.
			FULL stands for utilization of all feature types.
			In this experimental setting, the training set was divided to 10 parts and a 10-fold cross validation test is executed.
			Each time, we use 9 parts as thelabeled training data fo
