    The commonality between two words consists of the dependency triples that appear in the descriptions of both words.
    For example, (3) is the the description of the word &amp;quot;cell&amp;quot;.
    II cell, obj-of, contain11=4 obj-of, decorate11=2 Icell, nmod, bacteriall=3 I cell, nmod, blood vessell1=1 I cell, nmod, body11=2 Icell, nmod, bone marrow 11=2 Icell, nmod, burial 11=1 J cell, nmod, chameleon11=1 Assuming that the frequency counts of the dependency triples are independent of each other, the information contained in the description of a word is the sum of the information contained in each individual frequency count.
    To measure the information contained in the statement Ilw, r, Il=c, we first measure the amount of information in the statement that a randomly selected dependency triple is (w, r, w') when we do not know the value of 11w, r, will.
    We then measure the amount of information in the same statement when we do know the value of11w, r, w' II.
    The difference between th
