e ways to enhance quality in the face of worker error.
    More workers can be used, as described in previous sections.
    Another method is to use Amazon&#8217;s compensation mechanisms to give monetary bonuses to highlyperforming workers and deny payments to unreliable ones; this is useful, but beyond the scope of this paper.
    In this section we explore a third alternative, to model the reliability and biases of individual workers and correct for them.
    A wide number of methods have been explored to correct for the bias of annotators.
    Dawid and Skene (1979) are the first to consider the case of having multiple annotators per example but unknown true labels.
    They introduce an EM algorithm to simultaneously estimate annotator biases and latent label classes.
    Wiebe et al. (1999) analyze linguistic annotator agreement statistics to find bias, and use a similar model to correct labels.
    A large literature in biostatistics addresses this same problem for medical diagnosis.
