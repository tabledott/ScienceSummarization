rage value of leaf.
    That is, gold [ref] and the Newton iteration (6) reduces to: To compare candidates, we also need to know the gain D(Pliq old) &#8212; DQ311c16) for each candidate.
    This can be expressed as follows (Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty 1995): Putting everything together, the algorithm for feature selection has the following form.
    The array E[f] is assumed to have been initialized with the empirical expectations
  
  
    The procedure for adjusting field weights has much the same structure as the procedure for choosing initial weights.
    In terms of log weights, we wish to compute increments (61, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , 6) such that the new field, with log weights (al + 61, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , an + e5n) has a lower divergence than the old field (al, , an).
    We choose each 6, as the solution to the equation: Again, we use Newton's method.
    We wish to find 6 such that F1(6) = 0, where: We see that the expectations we need to compute by sampling from gold are of
