lter were applied.24 In order to construct a final classifier, we trained a decision tree on all 149 of the manually judged examples on which both judges agreed.
    This was then applied to the candidate pairs, producing a set of 1,741 HTML document pairs hypothesized to be valid translations of one another.
    By way of simple duplicate detection, if a pair of URLs appeared multiple times (under case-insensitive matching), it was counted only once.
    (Note that when this occurs, the duplicate pair will differ by at least one time stamp, and therefore a more sophisticated technique for eliminating duplication might extract more text.)
    The remaining set contained 1,399 pairs.25 Converting from HTML to plain text and tokenizing, the English documents in this corpus total approximately 673,108 tokens, with an average of 481 tokens per document; the Arabic side contains 845,891 tokens, averaging 605 tokens per document.26 We combined the structural and content-based approaches to detecting translations by
