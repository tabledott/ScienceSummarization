uent verbs, as well as 50 additional verbs, which covers 56% of the verbs by token in the corpus.
    We subjected each verb to a set of strict linguistic tests, as shown in Table 4 and verified primary verb usage against the corpus.
    Results from EVCA-Verber.
    In order to be able to compare article types and emphasize their differences, we selected articles that had the highest percentage of a particular verb class from each of the ten verb classes; we chose five articles from each EVCA class, yielding a total of 50 articles for analysis from the full set of 1236 articles.
    We observed that each class discriminated between different article types as shown in Table 5.
    In contrast to Table 2, the article types are well discriminated by verb class.
    For example, a concentration of communication class verbs (say, report, announce, .
    ..) indicated that the article type was a general announcement of short or medium length, or a longer feature article with many opinions in the text.
