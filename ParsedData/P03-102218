compared to e.g. those for 3mf.
    Only the feature wdist ic leads to an improvement over the baseline.
    Table 7 shows the results for the combined classifiers.
    The improvement in f-measure is due to the increase in recall while the precision shows only a slight decrease.
    Though some of the features of the baseline model (features 1-16) still occur in the decision tree learned, the feature ante exp type divides major parts of the tree quite nicely (see Figure 1).
    Below that node the feature ana npform is used to distinguish between negative (personal pronouns) and potential positive cases (demonstrative pronouns).
    This confirms the hypothesis by Eckert &amp; Strube (2000) and Byron (2002) to give high priority to these features.
    The decision tree fragment in Figure 1 correctly assigns the P label to 23-7=16 sentential antecedents.
    However, the most important problem is the large amount of pronouns without antecedents.
    The model does find (wrong) antecedents for a lot of pronoun
