 segmentations.Many errors can be corrected by new word detection.
			For example, person name ?????
			hap pens four times.
			In the first pass of segmentation, two of them are segmented correctly and the other two are mistakenly segmented as ??
			(they are segmented differently because Viterbi algorithm decodes based on context.).
			However, ?????
			is identified as a new word and added to the word list lexicon.
			In the second pass of segmentation, the other two mistakes are corrected.
	
	
			To make a comprehensive evaluation, we use allfour of the datasets from a recent Chinese word segmentation bake-off competition (Sproat and Emer son, 2003).
			These datasets represent four different segmentation standards.
			A summary of the datasets is shown in Table 1.
			The standard bake-off scoring program is used to calculate precision, recall, F1, and OOV word recall.
			5.1 Experimental design.
			Since CTB and PK are provided in the GB encod ing while AS and HK use the Big5 encoding, we convert AS and
