he corpus on which the system has been developed.
    In Section 4, we introduce the task to be performed by the system, which is described in Section 5.
    Results are presented and discussed in Section 6.
    Finally, Section 7 puts forward some conclusions.
  
  
    Negation has been a neglected area in open-domain natural language processing.
    Most research has been performed in the biomedical domain and has focused on detecting whether a medical term is negated or not, whereas in our approach we focus on detecting the full scope of negation signals.
    Chapman et al. (2001) developed NegEx, a regular expression based algorithm for determining whether a finding or disease mentioned within narrative medical reports is present or absent.
    The reported results are 94.51% precision and 77.84% recall.
    Mutalik et al. (2001) developed Negfinder, a rule-based system that recognises negated patterns in medical documents.
    It consists of two tools: a lexical scanner that uses regular expressions to
