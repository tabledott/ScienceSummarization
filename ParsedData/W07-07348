 and one for the relative weight assigned to the fragmentation penalty (y).
    In all versions of METEOR to date, these parameters were instantiated with the values a = 0.9, 0 = 3.0 and y = 0.5, based on early data experimentation.
    We recently conducted a more thorough investigation aimed at tuning these parameters based on several available data sets, with the goal of finding parameter settings that maximize correlation with human judgments.
    Human judgments come in the form of &#8220;adequacy&#8221; and &#8220;fluency&amp;quot; quantitative scores.
    In our experiments, we looked at optimizing parameters for each of these human judgment types separately, as well as optimizing parameters for the sum of adequacy and fluency.
    Parameter adaptation is also an issue in the newly created METEOR instances for other languages.
    We suspected that parameters that were optimized to maximize correlation with human judgments for English would not necessarily be optimal for other languages.
