	Online Large-Margin Training for Statistical Machine Translation
		We achieved a state of the art performance in statistical machine translation by using a large number of features with an onlinelarge-margin training algorithm.
		The mil lions of parameters were tuned only on a small development set consisting of less than1K sentences.
		Experiments on Arabic-to English translation indicated that a modeltrained with sparse binary features outper formed a conventional SMT system with a small number of features.
	
	
			The recent advances in statistical machine translation have been achieved by discriminatively training a small number of real-valued features based ei ther on (hierarchical) phrase-based translation (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al, 2003; Chiang, 2005) orsyntax-based translation (Galley et al, 2006).
			How ever, it does not scale well with a large number of features of the order of millions.
