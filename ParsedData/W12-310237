6.1, we associate a value between 1 and 5 with each sentence, representing the quality of that sentence.
    Given these values, our metric does not need an explicit reference ranking, the way the Spearman ranking correlation does.9 The goal of the DeltaAvg metric is to measure how valuable a proposed ranking (which we call a hypothesis ranking) is according to the extrinsic values associated with the test entries.
    We first define a parameterized version of this metric, called DeltaAvg[n].
    The following notations are used: for a given entry sentence s, V (s) represents the function that associates an extrinsic value to that entry; we extend this notation to a set S, with V (S) representing the average of all V (s), s &#8712; S. Intuitively, V (S) is a quantitative measure of the &#8220;quality&#8221; of the set S, as induced by the extrinsic values associated with the entries in S. For a set of ranked entries S and a parameter n, we denote by S1 the first quantile of set S (the highest-ranked entries)
