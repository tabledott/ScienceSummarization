l (based in this particular case on genii/genius).
    Also eliminated (and this is most regrettable) was NULL.n't (could/had/does/were/would /did).
    Because maximizing correct results is as important as testing the MDL model proposed here, I have also utilized a triage algorithm that departs from the MDLbased optimization in certain cases, which I shall identify in a moment.
    I believe that when the improvements identified in Section 10 below are made, the purely MDLbased algorithm will be more accurate; that prediction remains to be tested, to be sure.
    On this account, we discard any signature for which the total number of stem letters is less than five, and any signature consisting of a single, one-letter suffix; we keep, then, only signatures for which the savings in letter counts is greater than 15 (where savings in letter counts is simply the difference between the sum of the length of words spelled out as a monomorphemic word and the sum of the lengths of the stems and the suffixes); 15 is ch
