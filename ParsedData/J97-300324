 Another important consideration for rating a word-guessing rule is that the longer the affix or ending (S) of this rule, the more confident we are that it is not a coincidental one, even on small samples.
    For example, if the estimate for the word-ending o was obtained over a sample of five words and the estimate for the word-ending fulness was also obtained over a sample of five words, the latter is more representative, even though the sample size is the same.
    Thus we need to adjust the estimation error in accordance with the length of the affix or ending.
    A good way to do this is to decrease it proportionally to a value that increases along with the increase of the length.
    A suitable solution is to use the logarithm of the affix length: When the length of S (the affix or ending) is 1, the estimation error is not changed since log(1) is 0.
    For the rules with an affix or ending length of 2 the estimation error is reduced by 1 + log(2) = 1.3, for the length 3 this will be 1 + log(3) = 1.48,
