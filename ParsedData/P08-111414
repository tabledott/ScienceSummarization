    In addition to the baseline condition, and baseline plus Chiang&#8217;s (2005) original constituency feature, experimental conditions augmented the baseline with additional features as described in Section 3.
    All models were optimized and tested using the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002) with the NISTimplemented (&#8220;shortest&#8221;) effective reference length, on lowercased, tokenized outputs/references.
    Statistical significance of difference from the baseline BLEU score was measured by using paired bootstrap re-sampling (Koehn, 2004).9 For the Chinese-English translation experiments, we trained the translation model on the corpora in Table 1, totalling approximately 2.1 million sentence pairs after GIZA++ filtering for length ratio.
    Chinese text was segmented using the Stanford segmenter (Tseng et al., 2005).
    We trained a 5-gram language model using the English (target) side of the training se
