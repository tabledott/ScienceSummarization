the string &#945; a pattern, and the string Q a template.
    Non-terminals are indexed to show their association between a pattern and a template.
    All derivations start with a pair of associated start symbols, (51 , 51 ).
    Each step of a derivation involves the rewriting of a pair of associated non-terminals in both of the NL and MRL streams.
    Below is a derivation that would generate the sample sentence and its MR simultaneously: (Note that RULE is the start symbol for CLANG) (RULE 1 , RULE 1 ) &#8658; (if CONDITION 1 , DIRECTIVE 2 .
    , (CONDITION 1 DIRECTIVE 2 )) &#8658; (if TEAM 1 player UNUM 2 has the ball, DIR 3 .
    , ((bowner TEAM 1 {UNUM 2 }) DIR 3 )) &#8658; (if our player UNUM 1 has the ball, DIR 2 .
    , ((bowner our {UNUM 1 }) DIR 2 )) &#8658; (if our player 4 has the ball, DIRECTIVE 1 .
    , ((bowner our {4}) DIRECTIVE 1 )) &#8658; ... &#8658;(if our player 4 has the ball, then our player 6 should stay in the left side of our half.
