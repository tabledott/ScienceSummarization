 on small screens such as mobile phones or PDAs (Corston-Oliver, 2001), and, notably, summarisation (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003).
			Most prior work has focused on a specific instantiation of sentence compression, namely word deletion.
			Given an input sentence of words, w 1 , w 2 . . .
			w n , a compression is formed by dropping any subset of these words (Knight c ? 2008.

			and Marcu, 2002).
			The simplification renders the task computationally feasible, allowing efficient decoding using a dynamic program (Knight andMarcu, 2002; Turner and Charniak, 2005; McDon ald, 2006).
			Furthermore, constraining the problemto word deletion affords substantial modeling flexibility.
			Indeed, a variety of models have been successfully developed for this task ranging from in stantiations of the noisy-channel model (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Galley and
