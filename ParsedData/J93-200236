s are called adjuncts.
    On the other hand, the sense of on in John sprayed water on the ceiling is quite different.
    This sense, it can be argued, is available only because the lexical entry of spray specifies a location argument that can be realized as a PP.
    If anything significant is to be learned about individual words, the nonspecific cooccurrences of verbs with PPs (adjuncts) must be separated from the specific ones (arguments).
    It is not clear how a machine learning system could do this, although frequency might provide some clue.
    Worse, however, there are many cases in which even trained linguists lack clear intuitions.
    Despite a number of attempts to formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for the argument/adjunct distinction (e.g., Jackendoff 1977), there are many cases for which the various criteria do not agree or the judgments are unclear (Adams and Macfarland 1991).
    Thus, the Penn Treebank does not make the argument/adjunct distinction because their judges do not a
