0;with my eyes&#8221; should be attached to &#8220;the pizza&#8221; or not before it is allowed to build parts of the outer NP (&#8220;the boy who... &#8221;).
    In this case, the verb &#8220;saw&#8221; and the noun &#8220;boy&#8221; are both outside of the sight of the parser when deciding on the PP attachment, and it is forced to make a decision in ignorance, which, in many cases, leads to mistakes.
    The globally optimized MST does not suffer as much from such cases.
    We plan to address this deficiency in future work.
  
  
    Deterministic shift-reduce parsers are restricted by a strict left-to-right processing order.
    Such parsers can rely on rich syntactic information on the left, but not on the right, of the decision point.
    They are forced to commit early, and suffer from error propagation.
    Our non-directional parser addresses these deficiencies by discarding the strict left-to-right processing order, and attempting to make easier decisions before harder ones.
