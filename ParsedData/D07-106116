 to ??1.
			We experi mented with a range of return probabilities and found that our results were relatively insensitive to this parameter.
			Our convergence criteria was ? ?v(t?1) ? v(t) ? ?
			1 &lt; 10?10, which, for our graph with a return probability of ? = .1,was met after about two dozen iterations.
			This computation takes under two seconds on a modern desktop ma chine.
			Note that because M is sparse, each iteration of theabove computation is linear in the total number of non zero entries in P , i.e. linear in the total number of edges.
			Introducing an edge type that is dense would dramatically increase running time.
			3.3 Model variants.
			For this paper, we consider three model variants that dif fer based on which subset of the edge types are included 1The frequency-count derived edges are normalized by thelargest column sum.
			This effectively preserves relative term fre quency information across the graph and causes some columns to sum to less than one.
			We interpret this lost mass as a
