ve several person-years of development, plus often expensive proprietary lexicons and hand-tagged training corpora.
    In contrast, the current algorithm could be applied quite quickly and cheaply to this problem.
    It was originally developed for homograph disambiguation in text-to-speech synthesis (Sproat et al., 1992), and was applied to the problem of accent restoration with virtually no modifications in the code.
    It was applied to a new language, French, in a matter of days and with no special lexical resources or linguistic knowledge, basing its performance upon a strictly self-organizing analysis of the distributional properties of French text.
    The flexibility and generality of the algorithm and its potential feature set makes it readily applicable to other problems of recovering lost information from text corpora; I am currently pursuing its application to such problems as capitalization restoration and the task of recovering vowels in Hebrew text.
