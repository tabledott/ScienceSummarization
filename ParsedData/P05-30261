    Each approach and system has different advantages and disadvantages.
    While statistical systems provide broad coverage with little manpower, the quality of the corpus based systems rarely reaches the quality of knowledge based systems.
    With such a wide range of approaches to machine translation, it would be beneficial to have an effective framework for combining these systems into an MT system that carries many of the advantages of the individual systems and suffers from few of their disadvantages.
    Attempts at combining the output of different systems have proved useful in other areas of language technologies, such as the ROVER approach for speech recognition (Fiscu
