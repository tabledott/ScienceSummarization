    Each relation variable Rij is connected to its first entity Ei , and second entity Ej.
    We use N1 and N2 to denote the entity variables of a relation Rij.
    Specifically, Ei = N1(Rij) and Ej =N2(Rij).
    In addition, we define a set of constraints on the outcomes of the variables in V. C1 : G&#163; x GR &#8594; {0, 1} constraint values of the first argument of a relation.
    C2 is defined similarly and constrains the second argument a relation can take.
    For example, (born in, person) is in C1 but not in C2 because the first entity of relation born in has to be a person and the second entity can only be a location instead of a person.
    Note that while we define the constraints here as Boolean, our formalisms in fact allows for stochastic constraints.
    Also note that we can define a large number of constraints, such as CR : GR x GR &#8594; {0, 1} which constrain types of relations, etc.
    In fact, as will be clear in Sec.
    3 the language for defining constraints is very rich &#8211; li
