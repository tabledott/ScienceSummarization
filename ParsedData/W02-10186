re modeled by uniform distributions.
    We do not assume that is a hidden variable that generates pair , but rather that .
    Under these assumptions, it follows that the probability of generating a sentence pair (E, F) using concepts given by the product of all phrase-tophrase translation probabilities, yield bags of phrases that can be ordered linearly so as to obtain the sentences E and F. For example, the sentence pair &#8220;a b c&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;x y&#8221; can be generated using two concepts, (&#8220;a b&#8221; : &#8220;y&#8221;) and (&#8220;c&#8221; : &#8220;x&#8221;); or one concept, (&#8220;a b c&#8221; : &#8220;x y&#8221;), because in both cases the phrases in each language can be arranged in a sequence that would yield the original sentence pair.
    However, the same sentence pair cannot be generated using the concepts (&#8220;a b&#8221; : &#8220;y&#8221;) and (&#8220;c&#8221; : &#8220;y&#8221;) because the sequence &#8220;x y&#8221; cannot be recreated from the two phrases &#8220;y&#8221;
