 for anaphoric antecedents.
    Kameyama's specifications reduce the complexity in that the Cf-lists in general are shorter after splitting up a sentence into clauses.
    Therefore, the BFP-algorithm combined with her specifications has almost no strategic errors while the number of ambiguities remains constant.
    But this benefit is achieved at the expense of more errors caused by the intra-sentential specifications.
    These errors occur in cases like example (3), in which Kameyama's intrasentential strategy makes the correct antecedent less salient, indicating that a clause-based approach is too fine-grained and that the hierarchical syntactical structure as assumed by Kameyama does not have a great impact on anaphora resolution.
    I noted, too, that the BFP-algorithm can generate ambiguous readings for Ui when the pronoun in Ui does not co-specify the Cb(Ui_ ).
    In cases, where the C1 (U_1) contains more than one possible antecedent for the pronoun, several ambiguous readings with the same transi
