uot; can be represented as NP &amp;quot; S # VP # V, with &amp;quot; indicating upward movement in the parse tree and # downward movement.
    The other features used were the identity of the target word and the identity of the constituent's head word.
    The probability distributions calculated from the training data were P(fejpath), P(fejpath, t), and P(fejh, t), where fe indicates an event where the parse constituent in question is a frame element, path the path through the parse tree from the target word to the parse constituent, t the identity of the target word, and h the head word of the parse constituent.
    By varying the probability threshold at which a decision is made, one can plot a precision/recall curve as shown in Figure 5.
    P(fejpath, t) performs relatively poorly due to fragmentation of the training data (recall only about 30 sentences are available for each target word).
    While the lexical statistic P(fejh, t) alone is not useful as a classifier, using it in linear interpolation wit
