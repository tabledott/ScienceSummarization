    According to the judgements of the centroid annotator, there are 10 fully-compositional items, 12 items where neither the verb nor the particle is entailed, 15 where only the verb is entailed, and 3 where only the particle is entailed.
    It is surprising to notice that the majority view holds there to be no items in which the verb alone is contributing meaning.
    It could be the case that items where only the verb contributes meaning are rare, or that they are not represented in our dataset.
    Another possible, and to our minds more likely, conclusion is that the contribution of the head verb strongly affects the way in which participants view the whole item.
    Thus if a verb is considered to be contributing simplex semantics, the participant is likely to assume that the VPC is completely compositional, and conversely if a verb is considered to not be contributing simplex semantics, the participant is more likely to assume the VP
