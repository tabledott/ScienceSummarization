			A rule like (e) is particu larly unfortunate, since it allows the word were to be added without any other evidence that the VP should be in passive voice.
			On the other hand, the composed-rule derivation of C4 incorporates more linguistic evidence in its rules, and re-orderings are motivated by more syntactic context.
			Rule (p) is particularly appropriate to create a passive VP construct, since it expects a Chinese passive marker (?), an NP-C, and a verb in its rhs, and creates the were ... by construction at once in the left hand side.
			5.1 Syntactic translation tables.
			We evaluate the promise of our SBTM by analyz ing instances of translation tables (t-table).
