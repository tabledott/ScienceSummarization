hesis was not entailed.
    In such cases, we shouldn&#8217;t expect good generalization to test data, and human intuition about the &#8220;value&#8221; of specific features may be more reliable.
    Table 3 shows the values learned for selected feature weights.
    As expected, the features added adjunct in all context, modal yes, and text is factive were all found to be strong indicators of entailment, while date insert, date modifier insert, widening from text to hyp all indicate lack of entailment.
    Interestingly, text has neg marker and text &amp; hyp diffpolarity were also found to disfavor entailment; while this outcome is sensible, it was not anticipated or designed.
  
  
    The best current approaches to the problem of textual inference work by aligning semantic graphs, using a locally-decomposable alignment score as a proxy for strength of entailment.
    We have argued that such models suffer from three crucial limitations: an assumption of monotonicity, an assumption of locality, and a confou
