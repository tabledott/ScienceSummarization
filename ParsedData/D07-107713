se of the type ADJP, QP, PP, LCP, or NP.
			When the XP is an ADJP or a QP, no reordering is needed because the word order is the same as that of English.When the XP is a PP or an LCP, the DNP essentially corresponds to a prepositional phrase in En glish, which almost always appears after the noun being modified.
			Figure 5 shows an example where the XP in the DNP is a PP.
			The reordering rule to handle these two cases states that, if a parent NP has a child DNP which in turn has a child PP or LCP, then the DNP is repositioned after the last sibling NP.
			Figure 6 shows an example noun phrase for which the XP in the DNP is NP.
			On the surface, the Chinese?NP1 DEG NP2?
			sequence is analogous to the En glish possessive structure of ?NP1?s NP2?
