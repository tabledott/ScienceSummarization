ng teams focused on the cue phrases and sought to classify every token if it was a part of a cue phrase, then a sentence was predicted as uncertain if it contained at least one recognized cue phrase.
    Five systems followed a pure token classification approach (TC) for cue detection while others used sequential labeling techniques (usually Conditional Random Fields) to identify cue phrases in sentences (SL).
    The feature set employed in Task1 systems typically consisted of the wordform, its lemma or stem, POS and chunk codes and about the half of the participants constructed features from the dependency and/or constituent parse tree of the sentences as well (see Table 6 for details).
    It is interesting to see that the top ranked systems of Task1B followed a sequence labeling approach, while the best systems on Task1W applied a bag-of-words sentence classification.
    This may be due to the fact that biological sentences have relatively simple patterns.
    Thus the context of the cue words (token cla
