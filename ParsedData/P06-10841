 such a way that segmentation and tagging can be learned in parallel in one step.
    Results on a large scale evaluation indicate that this learning improves disambiguation for complex tag sets.
    Our method is applicable to other languages with affix morphology.
  
  
    Morphological disambiguation is the process of assigning one set of morphological features to each individual word in a text, according to the word context.
    In this work, we investigate morphological disambiguation in Modern Hebrew.
    We explore unsupervised learning method, which is more challenging than the supervised case.
    The main motivation for this approach is that despite the development of annotated corpora in Hebrew', there is still not enough data available for supervised training.
    The other reason, is that unsupervised methods can handle the dynamic nature of Modern Hebrew, as it evolves over time.
    In the case of English, because morphology is simpler, morphological disambiguation is generally covered under t
