word entries (phrasal verbs, etc.) we were left with 38,882 out of the original 160,595 word forms.
    For each of these word forms we fed the corresponding input (derived automatically from the lemmatisation and inflection specification provided by CELEX) to the generator.
    We compared the generator output with the original CELEX word forms, producing a list of mistakes apparently made by the generator, which we then checked by hand.
    In a number of cases either the CELEX lemmatisation was wrong in that it disagreed with the relevant entry in the Cambridge International Dictionary of English (Procter, 1995), or the output of the generator was correct even though it was not identical to the word form given in CELEX.
    We did not count these cases as mistakes.
    We also found that CELEX is inconsistent with respect to consonant doubling.
    For example, it includes the word form pettifogged,1 whereas it omits many consonant doubled words that are much more common (according to counts from the BNC).
