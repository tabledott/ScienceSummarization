he spurt number of instances of adjectives with positive polarity (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) idem, with adjectives of negative polarity number of instances in the spurt of each cue phrase and agreement/disagreement token listed in (Hirschberg and Litman, 1994; Cohen, 2002) .
    In 26.1% of the cases where a given speaker B disagrees with A, he or she will continue to disagree in the next exchange involving the same speaker and the same listener.
    Similarly with the same probability distribution, a tendency to agree is confirmed in 25% of the cases.
    The results in the last column are quite different from the two preceding ones.
    While agreements in response to agreements ( AGREEAGREE ) are slightly less probable than agreements without conditioning on any previous tag ( AGREE ), the probability of an agreement produced in response to a disagreement is quite high (with 23.4%), even higher than the proportion of agreements in the entire data (18.8%).
    This last result would arguably be qu
