hold value in [0,1].
			If we treat p i as the probability that a question belongs to Class i, the decision model yields a reasonable probabilistic interpretation.
			We use T = 0:95 in the experiments.
	
	
			We designed two experiments to test the accuracy ofour classifier on TREC questions.
			The first experi ment evaluates the contribution of different featuretypes to the quality of the classification.
			Our hi erarchical classifier is trained and tested using oneof the six feature sets defined in Sect.
			3.2 (we re peated the experiments on several different trainingand test sets).
			In the second experiment, we evaluate the advantage we get from the hierarchical clas sifier.
			We construct a multi-class classifier only for fine classes.
			This flat classifier takes all fine classes as its initial confusion set and classifies a questioninto fine classes directly.
			Its parameters and deci sion model are the same as those of the hierarchicalone.
			By comparing this flat classifier with our hi erar
