ntaining the empty derivation, { }: concatenation with the empty derivation is an identity operation.
    Derivations need not be complete.
    For instance, for CFGs, {(X &#8212;&gt; YZ, Y &#8212;&gt; y)} is a valid element, as is {(Y &#8212;&gt; y, X &#8212;&gt; x)}.
    In fact, { (X &#8212;&gt; A, B &#8212;&gt; b)} is a valid element, although it could not occur in a valid grammar derivation, or in a correctly functioning parser.
    An example of concatenation Potentially, derivation forests are sets of infinitely many items.
    However, it is still possible to store them using finite-sized representations.
    Elsewhere (Goodman 1998), we show how to implement derivation forests efficiently, using pointers, in a manner analogous to the typical implementation of parse forests, and also similar to the work of Billot and Lang (1989).
    Using these techniques, both union and concatenation can be implemented in constant time, and even infinite unions will be reasonably efficient. probable derivation of th
