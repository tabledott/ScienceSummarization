 task.3 For task A, the f-measure scores range from 0.34 to 0.62 for the strict scheme and from 0.41 to 0.63 for the relaxed scheme.
			For task B, the scores range from 0.66 to 0.80 (strict) and 0.71 to 0.81 (relaxed).
			Finally, task C scores range from 0.42 to 0.55 (strict) and from 0.56 to 0.66 (relaxed).The differences between the systems is not spec tacular.
			WVALI?s hybrid approach outperforms the other systems in task B and, using relaxed scoring, in task C as well.
			But for task A, the winners barely edge out the rest of the field.
			Similarly, for task C using strict scoring, there is no system that clearly separates itself from the field.It should be noted that for task A, and in lesser ex tent for task B, the XRCE-T system has recall scores that are far below all other systems.
			This seemsmostly due to a choice by the developers to not as sign a temporal relation if the syntactic analyzer did not find a clear syntactic relation between the two 3There was a strict separation between people
