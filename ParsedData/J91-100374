ones.
    The reason is that metonymic relations, unlike the others, are not discriminated by CS in terms of only five kinds of network path and seven kinds of cell matches.
    Instead, they consist of combinations of network paths and specialized matches of cells that have not fallen into a regular enough pattern to be represented systematically.
  
  
    Even for those semantic dependencies investigated, the interpretation of semantic relations seems to require more complexity than has been described so far in this paper.
    Consider the differences between the following sentences: Intuitively, sentence (20) is metaphorical while (27) is metaphorical/anomalous.
    In (20), the semantic relation between 'car' and 'drink' is thought to be metaphorical, and the isolated semantic relation between just 'drink' and 'gasoline' is anomalous, but the sentence as a whole is metaphorical because it is metaphorical that cars should use up gasoline.
    In (27), the semantic relation between 'car' and 'drink' is met
