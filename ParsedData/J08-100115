3).
    Candidate text structures may differ in terms of the selected propositions, the sequence in which facts are presented, the topology of the tree, or the order in which entities are introduced.
    A set of plausible candidates can be created via stochastic search (Mellish et al. 1998) or by a symbolic text planner following different text-formation rules (Kibble and Power 2004).
    The best candidate is chosen using an evaluation or ranking function often encoding coherence constraints.
    Although the type and complexity of constraints vary greatly across systems, they are commonly inspired by Rhetorical Structure Theory or entity-based constraints similar to the ones captured by our method.
    For instance, the ranking function used by Mellish et al. gives preference to plans where consecutive facts mention the same entities and is sensitive to the syntactic environment in which the entity is first introduced (e.g., in a subject or object position).
    Karamanis finds that a ranking function base
