ntextual polarity.
    For SVM, the improvement in accuracy achieved by the two-step approach is significant, but this is not true for the other algorithms.
    One fairly consistent difference between the two approaches is that the two-step approach scores slightly higher for neutral F-measure, and the onestep approach achieves higher F-measures for the polarity classes.
    The difference in negative F-measure is significant for BoosTexter, TiMBL, and Ripper.
    The exception to this is SVM.
    For SVM, the two-step approach achieves significantly higher positive and negative F-measures.
    One last question we consider is how much the neutral&#8211;polar features contribute to the performance of the one-step classifiers.
    The third line in Table 20 for BoosTexter, TiMBL, and Ripper gives the results for a one-step classifier trained without the neutral&#8211; polar features.
    Although the differences are not always large, excluding the neutral&#8211; polar features consistently degrades performanc
