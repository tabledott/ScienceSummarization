e description is that it denotes a function (in a logical sense); this function can be part of the meaning assigned to the definite description by the grammar (as in the beginning of X), or can be specified by context (as in the case of anaphoric definites).
    Fraurud's and Lobner's ideas can be translated into a requirement that a system have separate methods or rules for recognizing discourse-new descriptions (and in particular, Lobner's &amp;quot;semantically functional&amp;quot; definites) in addition to rules for resolving anaphoric definite descriptions; these rules may run in parallel with the rules for resolving anaphoric definites, rather than after them.
    Rather than deciding a priori on the question of whether the heuristic rules (in our case) for identifying discourse-new descriptions should be run in parallel with resolution or after it, we treated this as an empirical question.
    We made the architecture of the system fairly modular, so that we could both try different heuristics and try
