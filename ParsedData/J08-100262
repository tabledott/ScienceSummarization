arseness of the training data (tempts occurred only once in the training data).
    The resolution of this sort of ambiguity requires the refinement of a probabilistic model of lexical entries.
    Errors of verb phrases and subordinate clauses are similar to this example.
    Errors of argument/modifier distinction of noun phrases are mainly caused by temporal nouns and cardinal numbers.
    The resolution of these errors seems to require the identification of temporal expressions and usage of cardinal numbers.
    Errors of lexical ambiguities were mainly caused by idioms.
    For example, in Figure 25, compared with is a compound preposition, but the parser recognized it as a verb phrase.
    This indicates that the grammar or the disambiguation model requires the special treatment of idioms.
    Errors of verb subcategorization frames were mainly caused by difficult constructions such as insertions.
    Figure 25 shows that the parser could not identify the inserted clause (says John Siegel...) and a lexi
