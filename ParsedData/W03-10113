n and recall (Section 2).
    Second, we evaluate the framework at its optimal parameter settings for two different applications (Section 3), showing that it outperforms existing state-ofthe-art similarity measures for both high and low frequency nouns.
    Third, we begin to investigate to what extent existing similarity measures might be characterised in terms of parameter settings within the framework (Section 4).
    Fourth, we provide an understanding of why a single existing measure cannot achieve optimal results in every application of distributional similarity measures.
  
  
    In this section, we introduce the relevance of the Information Retrieval (IR) concepts of precision and recall in the context of word similarity.
    We provide combinatorial, probabilistic and mutual-information based models for precision and recall and discuss combining precision and recall to provide a single number in the context of a particular application.
    The similarity' of two nouns can be viewed as a measure of h
