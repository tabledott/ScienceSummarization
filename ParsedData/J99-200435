n rules.
    The effectiveness of a transformation rule to correct an error and the relative order of application of the rules are learned using a corpus.
    The learning procedure takes a gold corpus in which the words have been correctly annotated and a training corpus that is derived from the gold corpus by removing the annotations.
    The objective in the learning phase is to learn the optimum ordering of rule applications so as to minimize the number of tag mismatches between the training and the reference corpus.
    6.6.1 Experiments and Results.
    A EDTB model has been trained using templates defined on a three-word window.
    We trained the templates on 200,000 words' and tested on 47,000 words' of the WSJ corpus.
    The model performed at an accuracy of 90%.
    The EDTB model provides a great deal of flexibility to integrate domain-specific and linguistic information into the model.
    However, a major drawback of this approach is that the training procedure is extremely slow, which prevente
