e cut-off method for the ME method cannot be applied without modification since, as described in Section 3.4, the definition of the features are different in the two approaches.
    It can be said the features in the ME method is &#8220;finer&#8221; than those in SVMs.
    In this sense, the ME method allows us more flexible feature selection.
    This is an advantage of the ME method.
    The accuracies achieved by both systems can be said high compared with those of the previous methods if we consider that we have 24 named entity classes.
    However, the accuracies are not sufficient for a practical use.
    Though higher accuracy will be achieved with a larger annotated corpus, we should also explore more effective features and find effective feature combination methods to exploit such a large corpus maximally.
  
  
    We have described the use of Support Vector Machines for the biomedical named entity recognition task.
    To make the training of SVMs with the GENIA corpus practical, we proposed to spl
