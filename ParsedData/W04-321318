re left with a set of 16 roles: Agent, Amount, Attribute, Beneficiary, Cause, Destination, Experiencer, Instrument, Location, Material, Predicate, Recipient, Source, Stimulus, Theme, Time.
    Of these, 13 actually occur in our target verb classes.
    Our corpus consists of a random selection of 20% of the sentences in the British National Corpus (BNC Reference Guide, 2000).
    This corpus is processed by the chunker of Abney (1991), from whose output we can identify the probable head words of verb arguments with some degree of error.
    For instance, distant subjects are often not found, and PPs identified as arguments are often adjuncts.
    To reduce the number of adjuncts, we ignore dates and any PPs that are not known to (possibly) introduce an argument to one of the verbs in our extended set.
    We extracted two sets of sentences: a validation set consisting of 5 random examples of each target verb, and a test set, consisting of 10 random examples of each target verb.
    The data sets were chunked
