    Work started in October, 1997, and the system described above was not in place until midFebruary.
    1998.
    We believe that we can push the score of the MENE-only system higher by incorporating long-range reference-resolution on MENE's output.
    We are also missing a large number of acronyms which could be picked up by dynamically building them from entities which MENE had tagged elsewhere and then pulling that data in as a new class of feature.
    The other key element missing from the current system is a set of general compound features, which, as discussed above, would require the use of a more sophisticated feature selection algorithm.
    All three of these elements are present in systems such as Is&#176;Quest's (Kruplca and Hausman, 1998), and their absence from MENE probably explains much of the reason why the MENE-only system failed to perform at the state-of-the-art.
    We intend to add all of these elements to MENE in th
