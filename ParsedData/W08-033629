ow that an intermediate granularity is much more effective.
    Using an already competitive CRF segmentation model, we directly optimize segmentation granularity for translation quality, and obtain an improvement of 0.73 BLEU point on MT05 over our lexicon-based segmentation baseline.
    Second, we augment our CRF model with lexicon and proper noun features in order to improve segmentation consistency, which provide a 0.32 BLEU point improvement.
