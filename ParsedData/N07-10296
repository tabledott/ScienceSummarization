    The NIST BLEU-4 is a variant of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and is computed as where is the precision of -grams in the hypothesis given the reference and is a brevity penalty.
    The -gram counts from multiple references are accumulated in estimating the precisions.
    All system combination methods presented in this paper may be tuned to directly optimize either one of these automatic evaluation metrics.
    The tuning uses -best lists of hypotheses with various feature scores.
    The feature scores may be combined with tunable weights forming an arbitrary scoring function.
    As the derivatives of this function are not usually available, Brent&#8217;s modification of Powell&#8217;s method (Brent, 1973) may be used to find weights that optimize the appropriate evaluation metric in the re-scored -best list.
    The optimization starts at a random initial point in the -dimensional parameter space, first searching through an initial set of basis vectors.
    As searching repeatedly through the set
