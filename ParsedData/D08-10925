    Our model is a general log-linear (maximum entropy) distribution over triples (t, a, t') for sentence pairs (s, s'): Features are thus defined over (t, a, t') triples; we discuss specific features below.
  
  
    To use our model, we need features of a triple (t, a, t') which encode both the monolingual quality of the trees as well as the quality of the alignment between them.
    We introduce a variety of features in the next sections.
    To capture basic monolingual parse quality, we begin with a single source and a single target feature whose values are the log likelihood of the source tree t and the target tree t', respectively, as given by our baseline monolingual parsers.
    These two features are called SOURCELL and TARGETLL respectively.
    It is certainly possible to augment these simple features with what would amount to monolingual reranking features, but we do not explore that option here.
    Note that with only these two features, little can be learned: all posi
