 is rejected.
    The results of the use of stage 3 on the sample set of collocations are similar to the manual evaluation in terms of numbers: about 40% of the collocations were labeled (T) by Xtract stage 3, and about 60% were rejected (U).
    Figure 13 shows the overlap of the classifications made by Xtract and the lexicographer.
    In the figure, the first diagram on the left represents the breakdown in T and U of each of the manual categories (Y-YY and N).
    The diagram on the right represents the breakdown in Y-YY and N of the T and U categories.
    For example, the first column of the diagram on the left represents the application of Xtract stage 3 on the YY collocations.
    It shows that 94% of the collocations accepted by the lexicographer were also accepted by Xtract.
    In other words, this means that the recall of the third stage of Xtract is 94%.
    The first column of the diagram on the right represents the lexicographic evaluation of the collocations automatically accepted by Xtract.
