ering might result in the inclusion of some unrelated sentences.
    Evaluation involving human judges revealed that Simfinder identifies similar sentences with 49.3% precision at 52.9% recall (Hatzivassiloglou, Klavans, and Eskin 1999).
    We will discuss later how this error rate influences sentence fusion.
    To identify themes, Simfinder extracts linguistically motivated features for each sentence, including WordNet synsets (Miller et al. 1990) and syntactic dependencies, such as subject&#8211;verb and verb&#8211;object relations.
    A log-linear regression model is used to combine the evidence from the various features into a single similarity value.
    The model was trained on a large set of sentences which were manually marked for similarity.
    The output of the model is a listing of real-valued similarity values on sentence pairs.
    These similarity values are fed into a clustering algorithm that partitions the sentences into closely related groups.
