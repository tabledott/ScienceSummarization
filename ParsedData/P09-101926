    The new Lattice MBR decoder achieves a 20X speedup relative to either FSAMBR implementation described in Tromble et al. (2008) or MBR on 1000-best lists.
    The algorithm gives comparable results relative to FSAMBR.
    On hypergraphs produced by Hierarchical and Syntax Augmented MT systems, our MBR algorithm gives a 7X speedup relative to 1000-best MBR while giving comparable or even better performance.
    Lattice MBR decoding is obtained under a linear approximation to BLEU, where the weights are obtained using n-gram precisions derived from development data.
    This may not be optimal in practice for unseen test sets and language pairs, and the resulting linear loss may be quite different from the corpus level BLEU.
    In this paper, we have described how MERT can be employed to estimate the weights for the linear loss function to maximize BLEU on a development set.
    On an experiment with 40 language pairs, we obtain improvements on 26 pairs, no difference on 8 pairs and d
