uot;ght consisted of normalized presence-of-feature (rather than frequency-of-feature) vectors.
    The ind value 5SVMlight is available at svmlight.joachims.org.
    Default parameters were used, although experimentation with different parameter settings is an important direction for future work (Daelemans and Hoste, 2002; Munson et al., 2005). for each speech segment s was based on the signed distance d(s) from the vector representing s to the trained SVM decision plane: where &#963;s is the standard deviation of d(s) over all speech segments s in the debate in question, and ind(s, N) def = 1 &#8722; ind(s, Y).
    We now turn to the more interesting problem of representing the preferences that speech segments may have for being assigned to the same class.
    A wide range of relationships between text segments can be modeled as positive-strength links.
    Here we discuss two types of constraints that are considered in this work.
    Same-speaker constraints: In Congressional debates and in general social-
