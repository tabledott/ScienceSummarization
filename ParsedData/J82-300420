    However, we are really interested in finding parse trees, not just the number of ambiguous interpretations.
    We could extend the table lookup algorithm to find trees rather than ambiguity coefficients, by modifying the table to store trees instead of numbers.
    For parsing purposes, Cati can be thought of as a pointer to the ith entry of the table.
    So, for a sentence in grammar (5a), for example, the machine could count the number of occurrences of &amp;quot;and John&amp;quot; and then retrieve the table entry for that number. index trees [John and [John and John]]] The table would be more general if it did not specify the lexical items at the leaves.
    Let us replace the table above with index trees and assume the machine can bind the x's to the appropriate lexical items.
    There is a real problem with this table lookup machine.
    The parse trees may not be exactly correct because the power series computation assumed that multiplication was associative, which is an appropriate assumption
