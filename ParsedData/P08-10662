 in TER on the NIST 04 Chinese-English MT evaluation set.
    In the rest of this section, we will briefly discuss previous work on hierarchical MT and dependency representations, which motivated our research.
    In section 2, we introduce the model of string-to-dependency decoding.
    Section 3 illustrates of the use of dependency language models.
    In section 4, we describe the implementation details of our MT system.
    We discuss experimental results in section 5, compare to related work in section 6, and draw conclusions in section 7.
    Graehl and Knight (2004) proposed the use of targettree-to-source-string transducers (xRS) to model translation.
    In xRS rules, the right-hand-side(rhs) of the target side is a tree with non-terminals(NTs), while the rhs of the source side is a string with NTs.
    Galley et al. (2006) extended this string-to-tree model by using Context-Free parse trees to represent the target side.
    A tree could represent multi-level transfer rules.
