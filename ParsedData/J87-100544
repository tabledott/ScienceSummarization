 so the else clause is taken.
    Let t = applicable-term(a) and y = apply(t,a).
    By the second condition just proved above, the latter computation terminates with p(y) &lt; p(a) &#8212; 1 &lt; n. Now let E = apply-terms(y, true).
    Again, by the induction hypothesis, this computation terminates with p( &#8364;) = 0.
    Since complete?
    = true, we return c as g, so p(P) = 0 as required.
    Condition 4: We must show that apply-terms(a false) terminates with result 13 such that p([3) &lt; p(a).
    By Lemma 1, we know that complex terms exist in a so the else clause is taken.
    Let t = applicable-term(a) and y = apply(t,a).
    By the second condition just proved above, this computation terminates with p(y) &lt; p(a) &#8212; 1 &lt; n. Now let E = apply-terms(y false).
    Again by the induction hypothesis, this computation terminates with p(E) &lt; p(y) &lt; n. Since complete?
    = false, we return E or a as p. In either case, p(I3) &lt; p(a) as required.
    We will use the four conditions just pr
