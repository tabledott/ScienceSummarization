a candidate extraction provides three types of information: the word itself wi, its POS tag t, and its short type si.
    The full set of features types is listed in Table 1, where we consider a generic elabel &#966;HD=enzyme elabel &#966;PF=A0_a ... &#966;SF=A0_a ... &#966;SF=a Note that the factor graph above has an equivalent RMN graph consisting of a one-node clique only, on which it is hard to visualize the various potentials involved.
    There are cases where different factor graphs may yield the same underlying RMN graph, which makes the factor graph representation preferable.
  
  
    Global clique templates enable us to model hypothesized influences between entities from the same document.
    They connect the label nodes of two or more entities, which, in the factor graph, translates into potential nodes connected to at least two label nodes.
    In our experiments we use three global templates: Overlap Template (OT): No two entity names overlap in the text i.e if the span of one entity is [Si, el
