 Bunt tested intercoder agreement with Bunt&#8217;s DIT++ (Bunt 2005), a scheme with 11 dimensions that builds on ideas from DAMSL and from Dynamic Interpretation Theory (Bunt 2000).
    In DIT++, tags can be hierarchically related: For example, the class information-seeking is viewed as consisting of two classes, yesno question (ynq) and wh-question (whq).
    The hierarchy is explicitly introduced in order to allow coders to leave some aspects of the coding undecided.
    For example, check is treated as a subclass of ynq in which, in addition, the speaker has a weak belief that the proposition that forms the belief is true.
    A coder who is not certain about the dialogue act performed using an utterance may simply choose to tag it as ynq.
    The distance metric d proposed by Geertzen and Bunt is based on the criterion that two communicative functions are related (d(c1, c2) &lt; 1) if they stand in an ancestor&#8211;offspring relation within a hierarchy.
    Furthermore, they argue, the magnitude of d(c1
