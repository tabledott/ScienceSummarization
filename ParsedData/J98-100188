e translation have incorporated recent methods developed for WSD, despite the importance of WSD for MT noted by Weaver almost 50 years ago.
    The most obvious effort to incorporate WSD methods into larger applications is in the field of information retrieval, and the results are ambiguous: Krovetz and Croft (1992) report only a slight improvement in retrieval using WSD methods; Voorhees (1993) and Sanderson (1994) indicate that retrieval degrades if disambiguation is not sufficiently precise.
    SparckJones (forthcoming) questions the utility of any NLP technique for document retrieval.
    On the other hand, Schtitze and Pedersen (1995) show a marked improvement in retrieval (14.4%) using a method that combines search-by-word and search-by-sense.
    It remains to be seen to what extent WSD can improve results in particular applications.
    However, if meaning is largely a function of use, it may be that the only relevant evaluation of WSD results is achievable in the context of specific tasks.
