ub and Van Loan 1996).
    We may think of this matrix UkEkVTk as a &#8220;smoothed&#8221; or &#8220;compressed&#8221; version of the original matrix.
    In the subsequent steps, we will be calculating cosines for row vectors.
    For this purpose, we can simplify calculations by dropping V. The cosine of two vectors is their dot product, after they have been normalized to unit length.
    The matrix XXT contains the dot products of all of the row vectors.
    We can find the dot product of the ith and jth row vectors by looking at the cell in row i, column j of the matrix XXT.
    Since VTV = I, we have XXT = UEVT(UEVT)T = UEVTVETUT = UE(UE)T, which means that we can calculate cosines with the smaller matrix UE, instead of using X = UEVT (Deerwester et al. 1990).

    Projection: Calculate UkEk (we use k = 300).
    This matrix has the same number of rows as X, but only k columns (instead of 2 x num patterns columns; in our experiments, that is 300 columns instead of 8,000).
    We can compare two wo
