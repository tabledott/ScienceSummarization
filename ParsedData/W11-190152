ores, the performance was not much different from the official task, indicating that mention boundary errors resulting from problems in parsing do not contribute significantly to the final output.23 One side benefit of performing this supplemental evaluation was that it revealed a subtle bug in the automatic scoring routine that we were using that could double-count duplicate correct mentions in a given entity chain.
    These can occur, for example, if the system considers a unit-production NP-PRP combination as two mentions that identify the exact same token in the text, and reports them as separate mentions.
    Most systems had a filter in their processing that selected only one of these duplicate mentions, but the kobdani system considered both as potential mentions, and its developers tuned their algorithm using that flawed version of the scorer.
    When we fixed the scorer and re-evaluated all of the systems, the kobdani system was the only one whose score was affected significantly, dropping by about
