nown erroneous output, which has its score set to zero.
    The internal EBMT scores range from 0 being perfect to 10,000 being worthless; but the scores are nonlinear.
    So a region selected by a threshold is converted linearly into scores ranging from zero to a normalized maximum EBMT score.
    The normalization levels were empirically determined in the initial experiment by having several individuals judge the comparative average quality of the outputs in an actual translation run.
    In every case, the base score produced by the scoring functions is currently multiplied by the length of the candidate in words, on the assumption that longer items are better.
    We intend to test a variety of functions in order to find the right contribution of the length factor.
    Figure 3 presents the chart walk algorithm used to produce a single, best, non-overlapping, contiguous combination (cover) of the available component translations, assuming correct component quality scores.
