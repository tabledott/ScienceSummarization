    We approach this problem as one of statistical machine translation (SMT), within the noisy channel model of Brown et al. (1993).
    That is, we seek to identify the optimal paraphrase T* of a sentence S by finding: T and S being sentences in the same language.
    We describe and evaluate an SMT-based paraphrase generation system that utilizes a monotone phrasal decoder to generate meaning-preserving paraphrases across multiple domains.
    By adopting at the outset a paradigm geared toward generating sentences, this approach overcomes many problems encountered by task-specific approaches.
    In particular, we show that SMT techniques can be extended to paraphrase given sufficient monolingual parallel data.1 We show that a huge corpus of comparable and alignable sentence pairs can be culled from ready-made topical/temporal clusters of news articles gathered on a daily basis from thousa
