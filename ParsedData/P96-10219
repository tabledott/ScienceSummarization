e as well.
    The size of the parameter set is greatly reduced from the x x (TI x I VI parameters of the alignment probabilities, down to a small set of jkl parameters.
    However, the search space remains the same.
    The A*-style stack-decoding approach is in some ways a carryover from the speech recognition architectures that inspired the channel translation model.
    It has proven highly effective for speech recognition in both accuracy and speed, where the search space contains no order variation since the acoustic and text streams can be assumed to be linearly aligned.
    But in contrast, for translation models the stack search alone does not adequately compensate for the combinatorially more complex space that results from permitting arbitrary order variations.
    Indeed, the stack-decoding approach remains impractically slow for translation, and has not achieved the same kind of speed as for speech recognition.
    The model we describe in this paper, like Dagan et al. 's model, encourages relat
