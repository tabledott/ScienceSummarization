re is less agreement on the restrictions that should apply to and 0, the portions that we refer to as the center of the rule.
    They are usually simple strings and some theorists would restrict them to single segments.
    However, these restrictions are without interesting mathematical consequences and we shall be open to all versions of the theory if we continue to take it that these can also denote arbitrary regular languages.
    It will be important to provide for multiple applications of a given rule, and indeed, this will turn out to be the major source of difficulty in reexpressing rewriting rules in terms of regular relations and finite-state transducers.
    We have already remarked that our methods work only if the part of the string that is actually rewritten by a rule is excluded from further rewriting by that same rule.
    The following optional rule shows that this restriction is necessary to guarantee regularity: ab/a b If this rule is allowed to rewrite material that it introduced on a pre
