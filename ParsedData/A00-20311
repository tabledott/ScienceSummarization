 indicate additional information about the syntactic or semantic role of the constituent.
    We have divided them into four categories (given in figure 2) based on those in the bracketing guidelines (Bies et al., 1995).
    A constituent can be tagged with multiple tags, but never with two tags from the same category.1 In actuality, the case where a constituent has tags from all four categories never happens, but constituents with three tags do occur (rarely).
    At a high level, we can simply say that having the function tag information for a given text is useful just because any further information would help.
    But specifically, there are distinct advantages for each of the various categories.
    Grammatical tags are useful for any application trying to follow the thread of the text&#8212;they find the 'who does what' of each clause, which can be useful to gain information about the situation or to learn more about the behaviour of the words in the sentence.
