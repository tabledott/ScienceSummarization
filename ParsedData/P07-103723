he two systems gives a BLEU score of 0.441, indicating that the combination provides significant room for improvement (cf.
    Table 2).
    However, our efforts to build a system that benefits from the combination using a simple loglinear combination of the two models did not give any significant performance change relative to the baseline CCG system.
    Obviously, more informed ways of combining the two could result in better performance than a simple log-linear interpolation of the components.
    Figure 3 shows some example system output.
    While the baseline system omits the verb giving &#8220;the authorities that it had...&#8221;, both the LTAG and CCG found a formulation &#8220;authorities reported that&#8221; with a closer meaning to the reference translation &#8220;The authorities said that&#8221;.
    Omitting verbs turns out to be a problem for the baseline system when translating the notorious verbless Arabic sentences (see Figure 4).
    The supertagged systems have a more grammatically strict
