on quality and computational cost on a large-scale translation task.
    Taking this further, we test MIRA on two classes of features that make use of syntactic information and hierarchical structure.
    First, we generalize Marton and Resnik&#8217;s (2008) soft syntactic constraints by training all of them simultaneously; and, second, we introduce a novel structural distortion model.
    We obtain significant improvements in both cases, and further large improvements when the two feature sets are combined.
    The paper proceeds as follows.
    We describe our training algorithm in section 2; our generalization of Marton and Resnik&#8217;s soft syntactic constraints in section 3; our novel structural distortion features in section 4; and experimental results in section 5.
  
  
    The translation model is a standard linear model (Och and Ney, 2002), which we train using MIRA (Crammer and Singer, 2003; Crammer et al., 2006), following Watanabe et al. (2007).
    We describe the basic algorithm first and the
