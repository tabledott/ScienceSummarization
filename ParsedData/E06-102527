PNOaccuracy results were .635 (with standard deviation Q = .030) and .603 (Q = .036), a mere 6.06% and 8.64% deterioration from the best results reported above.
    This seems to indicate that the levels of performance obtained may be hard to improve upon, especially if working in a similar framework.
    Let us analyse the individual dimensions of the problem.
    Concerning the three approaches to classification described in Section 4.3, Approach II outperforms the other two, but by an extremely narrow margin.
    As for the choice of learners, on average the best performer is NB, but again by a very small margin wrt the others.
    On average, the 10We observed this trend in all of our experiments. best reduction factor for feature selection turns out to be 50%, but the performance drop we witness in approaching 99% (a dramatic reduction factor) is extremely graceful.
    As for the choice of TrKo , we note that Tro and Tr4o elicit comparable levels of performance, with the former performing best at SO-acc
