  Loosely Tree-Based Alignment For Machine Translation
  
    We augment a model of translation based on re-ordering nodes in syntactic trees in order to allow alignments not conforming to the original tree structure, while keeping computational complexity polynomial in the sentence length.
    This is done by adding a new subtree cloning operation to either tree-to-string or tree-to-tree alignment algorithms.
  
  
    Systems for automatic translation between languages have been divided into transfer-based approaches, which rely on interpreting the source string into an abstract semantic representation from which text is generated in the target language, and statistical approaches, pioneered by Brown et al. (1990), which estimate parameters for a model of word-to-word correspondences and word re-orderings directly from large corpora of parallel bilingual text.
    Only recently have hybrid approaches begun to emerge, which apply probabilistic models to a structured representation of the source text.
