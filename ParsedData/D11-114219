stic regression classifier to assign a confidence score to each extraction, which uses the features shown in Table 4.
    All of these features are efficiently computable and relation independent.
    We trained the confidence function by manually labeling the extractions from a set of 1, 000 sentences from the Web and Wikipedia as correct or incorrect.
    Previous open extractors require labeled training data to learn a model of relations, which is then used to extract relation phrases from text.
    In contrast, REVERB uses a specified model of relations for extraction, and requires labeled data only for assigning confidence scores to its extractions.
    Learning a confidence function is a much simpler task than learning a full model of relations, using two orders of magnitude fewer training examples than TEXTRUNNER or WOE.
    The model of relation phrases used by REVERB is specified, but could a TEXTRUNNER-like system learn this model from training data?
    While it is difficult to answer such a questi
