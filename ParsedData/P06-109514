nstances according to the same distribution as the unclosed data.
    Table 3 shows these results.
    The greater class distribution skew in the closed data clearly contributes to improved accuracy.
    However, when using the same class distribution as the unclosed data (removing factor (2) from above), the accuracy, 76%, is higher than using the full unclosed data.
    This indicates that closure does indeed help according to factor (3).
  
  
    Humans have strong intuitions about rules for temporal ordering, as we indicated in discussing sentences (1) to (3).
    Such intuitions led to the development of pattern matching rules incorporated in a TLINK tagger called GTag.
    GTag takes a document with TimeML tags, along with syntactic information from part-of-speech tagging and chunking from Carafe, and then uses 187 syntactic and lexical rules to infer and label TLINKs between tagged events and other tagged events or times.
    The tagger takes pairs of TLINKable items (event and/or time) and searches f
