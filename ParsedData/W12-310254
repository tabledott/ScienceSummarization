Avg metric scores (Equation 15) as primary key and the Spearman correlation scores as secondary key.
    The winning submissions for the ranking subtask are SDLLW&#8217;s M5PbestDeltaAvg and SVM entries, which have DeltaAvg scores of 0.63 and 0.61, respectively.
    The difference with respect to all the other submissions is statistically significant at p = 0.05, using pairwise bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004).
    The state-of-the-art baseline system has a DeltaAvg score of 0.55 (Spearman rank correlation of 0.58).
    Five other submissions have performances that are not different from the baseline at a statistically-significant level (p = 0.05), as shown by the gray area in the middle of Table 12.
    Three submissions scored higher than the baseline system at p = 0.05 (systems above the middle gray area), which indicates that this shared-task succeeded in pushing the state-of-the-art performance to new levels.
    The range of performance for the submissions in the ranking task varies from a DeltaAvg of
