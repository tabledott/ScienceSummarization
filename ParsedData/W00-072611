sion+recall) with 0.1 (van Rijsbergen, 1975).
    The latter rate has been used as the target for optimization4.
  
  
    The eleven systems that have been applied to the CoNLL-2000 shared task can be divided in four groups: Vilain and Day (2000) approached the shared task in three different ways.
    The most successful was an application of the Alembic parser which uses transformation-based rules.
    Johansson (2000) uses context-sensitive and contextfree rules for transforming part-of-speech (POS) tag sequences to chunk tag sequences.
    Dejean (2000) has applied the theory refinement system ALLiS to the shared task.
    In order to obtain a system which could process XML formatted data while using context information, he has used three extra tools.
    Veenstra and Van den Bosch (2000) examined different parameter settings of a memory-based learning algorithm.
    They found that modified value difference metric applied to POS information only worked best.
    A large number of the systems applied to t
