  Ip(S) I Thus, like the scheme proposed in Sundheim et al ., we have an aesthetically pleasing inverse relationship between precision and recall .
  For the example above, these formul a yield a precision of 1/2, which is intuitively appropriate, since of the two minimum link s needed to generate the response class {A B C}, the key only provides one, B-C .
  To extend from a single response to a complete test set T, we once again sum over the tes t set, this time iterating over response equivalence classes .
  Table 1 shows the precision and recall scores, using the model-theoretic measures , for al l of the examples given in Sundheim et al.
  Note that these results agree with the origina l scoring proposal for the first three cases, but agree with intuition for the last two .
