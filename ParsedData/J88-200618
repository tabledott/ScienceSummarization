e above), the past perfect also makes demands on having some reference point already estabBonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor lished in the context.
    Thus it cannot be in terms of the event described in a tensed clause that tense is anaphoric.
    Instead, several people (Steedman 1982, Hinrichs 1986, Bauerle 1979) have argued that it is that part of tense called by Reichenbach (1947) the point of reference (here abbreviated RT) that is anaphoric.
    This can be seen by considering the following example: 8. a. John went to the hospital. b.
    He had twisted his ankle on a patch of ice.
    It is not the point of the event (here abbreviated ET) of John's twisting his ankle that is interpreted anaphorically with respect to his going to the hospital.
    Rather, it is the RT of the second clause: its ET is interpreted as prior to that because the clause is in the past perfect (see above).
    I will now review briefly Hinrichs's proposal as to how tensed clauses are interpreted in context, in orde
