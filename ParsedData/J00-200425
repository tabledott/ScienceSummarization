the new parameter estimates and the old ones is where z is a normalizing factor.'
    It is instructive to consider the form of Equation 14 when all the translation probabilities trans(v1u) for a particular u are initialized to the same constant p, as Brown et al. (1993b, 273) actually do: The initial translation probability trans1(v1u) is set proportional to the co-occurrence count of u and v and inversely proportional to the length of each segment U in which u occurs.
    The intuition behind the numerator is central to most bitext-based translation models: The more often two words co-occur, the more likely they are to be mutual translations.
    The intuition behind the denominator is that the co-occurrence count of u and v should be discounted to the degree that v also co-occurs with other words in the same segment pair.
    Now consider how Equation 16 would behave if all the text segments on each side were of the same length,' so that each token of v co-occurs with exactly c words (where c is constant):
