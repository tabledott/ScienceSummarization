 that a decoded sentence that is in any of the first three categories (exact, alternate, or different) represents a reasonable translation.
    By this criterion, the system performed successfully 48% of the time.
    As an alternate measure of the system's performance, one of us corrected each of the sentences in the last three categories (different, wrong, and ungrammatical) to either the exact or the alternate category.
    Counting one stroke for each letter that must be deleted and one stroke for each letter that must be inserted, 776 strokes were needed to repair all of the decoded sentences.
    This compares with the 1,916 strokes required to generate all of the Hansard translations from scratch.
    Thus, to the extent that translation time can be equated with key strokes, the system reduces the work by about 60%.
  
  
    There are many ways in which the simple models described in this paper can be improved.
    We expect some improvement from estimating the parameters on more data.
