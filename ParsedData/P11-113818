 Table 1.
    Given the mention m and the top-ranked disambiguation t, the linker attempts to decide whether t is indeed the correct disambiguation of m. The linker includes the same features as the ranker, plus additional features we expect to be particularly relevant to the task.
    We include the confidence of the ranker in t with respect to second-best disambiguation t&#8242;, intended to estimate whether the ranker may have made a mistake.
    We also include several properties of the mention m: the entropy of the distribution P(tlm), the percent of Wikipedia titles in which m appears hyperlinked versus the percent of times m appears as plain text, whether m was detected by NER as a named entity, and a Good-Turing estimate of how likely m is to be out-of-Wikipedia concept based on the counts in P(t1m).
    We train the coefficients for the ranker features using a linear Ranking Support Vector Machine, using training data gathered from Wikipedia.
    Wikipedia links are considered gold-standard links for
