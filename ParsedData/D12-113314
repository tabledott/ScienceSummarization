e that refers to the part-of-speech tag of a word w in the buffer B will in our system refer to the topscoring tag &#960;1(w), rather than the finally predicted tag.
    By contrast, for a word in the stack E, part-ofspeech features refer to the tag &#960;(w) chosen when shifting w onto the stack (which may or may not be the same as &#960;1(w)).
    In addition to the standard features for transitionbased dependency parsing, we have added features specifically to improve the tagging step in the joint model.
    The templates for these features, which are specified in Figure 3, all involve the ith best tag assigned to the first word of the buffer B (the next word to be shifted in a SHIFTP transition) in combination with neighboring words, word prefixes, word suffixes, score differences and tag rank.
    Finally, in some experiments, we make use of two additional feature sets, which we call graph features (G) and cluster features (C), respectively.
    Graph features are defined over the factors of a graph-base
