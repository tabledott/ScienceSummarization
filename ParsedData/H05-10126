presents the state visit penalty for state i, Z(li?1) is the normalization constant and dist(li, li?1) = min(|li ? li?1|, |li ? fi|) + a. Here a is a penalty for a zero distance transition andis set to 1 in the experiments below.
			The min operator chooses the lowest cost transition distance ei ther from the previous state or the frontier state, fi, which is the right most state that has been visited (even though Arabic is normally displayed right to left, we make our Arabic state graphs from left toright).
			This is a language specific criteria and in tended to model the adjective noun reversal between English and Arabic.
			Once the current noun phrase is completed, the next word often aligns to the statejust beyond frontier state.
			As an example, in Fig ure 1, the verb ?pointed?
			aligns to the first Arabic word ?wA$Art?, and aligning the ?to?
			to its Arabic counterpart ?Aly?
			would incur normally a distance of 3 but with the frontier notion it incurs only a penalty of 1 on the hypothesis that ali
