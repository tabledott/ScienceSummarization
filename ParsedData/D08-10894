rogress as one single phrase, and the displacement of of the region with respect to thisphrase can be treated as a swap.
			To be able iden tify that adjacent blocks (e.g., the development and and progress) can be merged into larger blocks, ourmodel infers binary (non-linguistic) trees reminis cent of (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005).
			Crucially, our work distinguishes itself from previous hierarchical models in that it does not rely on any cubic-timeparsing algorithms such as CKY (used in, e.g., (Chiang, 2005)) or the Earley algorithm (used in (Watan abe et al, 2006)).
			Since our reordering model doesnot attempt to resolve natural language ambiguities, we can effectively rely on (linear-time) shiftreduce parsing, which is done jointly with left-toright phrase-based beam decoding and thus intro duces no asymptotic change in running time.
			Assuch, the hierarchical model presented in this paper maintains all the effectiveness and speed advantages of statistical phrase-based systems, while be ing able to capture s
