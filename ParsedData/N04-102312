ormation of translations of the same class.
    Maybe knowing that is better than may be useless for training to some extent, but knowing is better than is useful, if .
    Although we cannot give an affirmative answer at this time, it is at least reasonable to use the ordering information.
    The problem is how to use the ordering information.
    In addition, we only want to maintain the order of two candidates if their ranks are far away from each other.
    On the other hand, we do not care the order of two translations whose ranks are very close, e.g.
    100 and 101.
    Thus insensitive ordinal regression is more desirable and is the approach we follow in this paper.
    However, reranking is not an ordinal regression problem.
    In reranking evaluation, we are only interested in the quality of the translation with the highest score, and we do not care the order of bad translations.
    Therefore we cannot simply regard a reranking problem as an ordinal regression problem, since they have different d
