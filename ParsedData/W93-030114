 problematic.
    First, since there are no sentence boundaries, there are no direct equivalents for i, j, in and 1.
    Secondly, there are too many parameters to be estimated, given the limited size of our corpora (one parameter for each combination of i, j, in and 1).
    Fortunately, these parameters are highly redundant.
    For example, it is likely that a(i1j, m, 1) will be very close to a(i + 11j+ 1, m, /) and a(i1j, m + 1,1+1).
    In order to deal with these concerns, we replace probabilities of the form a(iIj, in, 1) with a small set of offset probabilities.
    We use k to denote the offset between i, an English position which corresponds to the French position j, and the English position which the input alignment I connects to j: k = i &#8212;I(j).
    An offset probability, o(k), is the probability of having an offset k for some arbitrary connection.
    According to (8), k ranges between &#8212;w and w. Thus, instead of equation 6, we have where CON is the set of all connections and COArk is th
