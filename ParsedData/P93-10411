stituents of the text structure is a text segment.
    A text segment, whether or not it is explicitly marked, as are sentences and paragraphs, is defined as a sequence of clauses or sentences that display local coherence.
    It resembles a scene in a movie, which describes the same objects in the same situation.
    This paper proposes an indicator, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP), which locates segment boundaries in a narrative text.
    LCP is a record of lexical cohesiveness of words in a sequence of text.
    Lexical cohesiveness is defined as word similarity (Kozima and Furugori, 1993) computed by spreading activation on a semantic network.
    Hills and valleys of LCP closely correlate with changing of segments.
  
  
    Several methods to capture segment boundaries have been proposed in the studies of text structure.
    For example, cue phrases play an important role in signaling segment changes.
    (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) However, such clues are not directly based on coherence which fo
