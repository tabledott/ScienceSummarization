sistently beats the PCFG on its own, they offer slight, complementary improvements on small training datasets of 32 and 64 sentences (Table 7).
    The bilingual parser without the English head span filter gives a small recall improvement on average at similar precision.
    Neither of these differences is significant when measured with a paired-sample t-test.
    In contrast, the parser with the English head span filter sacrifices significantly on recall for a small but significant gain in precision at the 0.01 level.
    Crossing brackets at all levels are significantly lower with the English head span filter.
    We can describe this effect as a filtering of Korean constituents by the English model and word alignments.
    Constituents that are not strongly evident on the English side are simply removed.
    On small training datasets, this effect is positive: although good constituents are lost so that recall is poor compared to the PCFG, precision and crossing brackets are improved.
