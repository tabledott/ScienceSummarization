 that it does not give any credit to a candidate sentence if the sentence does not have any word pair co-occurring with its references.
    For example, the following sentence has a ROUGE-S score of zero: S5. gunman the killed police S5 is the exact reverse of S1 and there is no skip bigram match between them.
    However, we would like to differentiate sentences similar to S5 from sentences that do not have single word cooccurrence with S1.
    To achieve this, we extend ROUGE-S with the addition of unigram as counting unit.
    The extended version is called ROUGE-SU.
    We can also obtain ROUGE-SU from ROUGE-S by adding a begin-of-sentence marker at the beginning of candidate and reference sentences.
  
  
    To assess the effectiveness of ROUGE measures, we compute the correlation between ROUGE assigned summary scores and human assigned summary scores.
    The intuition is that a good evaluation measure should assign a good score to a good summary and a bad score to a bad summary.
