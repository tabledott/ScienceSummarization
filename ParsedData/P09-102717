 respectively, and used the accuracy metric to measure the overall performance of the system.
    The metrics are defined the same as in general text categorization.
    In the experiments, the proposed co-training approach (CoTrain) is compared with the following baseline methods: SVM(CN): This method applies the inductive SVM with only Chinese features for sentiment classification in the Chinese view.
    Only Englishto-Chinese translation is needed.
    And the unlabeled set is not used.
    SVM(EN): This method applies the inductive SVM with only English features for sentiment classification in the English view.
    Only Chineseto-English translation is needed.
    And the unlabeled set is not used.
    SVM(ENCN1): This method applies the inductive SVM with both English and Chinese features for sentiment classification in the two views.
    Both English-to-Chinese and Chinese-toEnglish translations are required.
    And the unlabeled set is not used.
    SVM(ENCN2): This method combines the results of SVM
