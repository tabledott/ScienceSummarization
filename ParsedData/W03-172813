closed track experiments on the first Sighan Bakeoff data show that the LMR algorithm produces promising results.
    Our system ranks the second when tested on the Academia Sinica corpus and third on the Hong Kong City University corpus.
    In the future, we will try to incorporate a large word list into our tagger to test its performance on open track experiments.
    Its high accuracy on makes it a good candidate as a general purpose segmenter.
