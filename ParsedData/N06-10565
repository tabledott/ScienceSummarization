e the semantic parsing model of WASP, it is best to start with an example.
    Consider the task of translating the sentence in Figure 1 into its MR in CLANG.
    To achieve this task, we may first analyze the syntactic structure of the sentence using a semantic grammar (Allen, 1995), whose nonterminals are the ones in the CLANG grammar.
    The meaning of the sentence is then obtained by combining the meanings of its sub-parts according to the semantic parse.
    Figure 3(a) shows a possible partial semantic parse of the sample sentence based on CLANG non-terminals (UNUM stands for uniform number).
    Figure 3(b) shows the corresponding CLANG parse from which the MR is constructed.
    This process can be formalized as an instance of synchronous parsing (Aho and Ullman, 1972), originally developed as a theory of compilers in which syntax analysis and code generation are combined into a single phase.
    Synchronous parsing has seen a surge of interest recently in the machine translation community as a way o
