 and Knight (2003) show some success in re-rankingnoun phrases for German-English.
			In their approaches, first, an n-best list with the best transla tions is generated for each input sentence.
			Then, the n-best list is enriched with additional features, for instance by syntactically parsing each candidate translation and adding a parse score.
			The additional features are used to rescore the n-best list, resulting possibly in a better best translation for the sentence.
			The goal of integrating syntactic informationinto the translation model has prompted many re searchers to pursue tree-based transfer models (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al, 1998; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Melamed, 2004; Menezes and Quirk, 2005; Galley et al, 2006), with increasingly encouraging results.
			Our goal is complementary to these efforts:we are less interested in recursive syntactic struc ture, but in richer annotation at the word level.
			In future work, these approaches may be combined.
