 algorithm is scaled up more seriously to generate large numbers of parallel documents, this time for English and French, and again subjected to formal evaluation (Section 4).
    The concrete end result reported here is an automatically acquired English-French parallel corpus of Web documents comprising 2491 document pairs, approximately 1.5 million words per language (without markup), containing little or no noise.
  
  
    This section is a brief summary of the STRAND system and previously reported preliminary results (Resnik, 1998).
    The STRAND architecture is organized as a pipeline, beginning with a candidate generation stage that (over-)generates candidate pairs of documents that might be parallel translations.
    (See Figure 1.)
    The first implementation of the generation stage used a query to the Altavista search engine to generate pages that could be viewed as &amp;quot;parents&amp;quot; of pages in parallel translation, by asking for pages containing one portion of anchor text (the readable
