   After generating our ranked guesses, the position of the correct event is averaged over all 740 tests for the final score.
    We penalize unseen events by setting their ranked position to the length of the guess list (ranging from 2k to 15k).
    Figure 1 is an example of a ranked guess list for a short chain of three events.
    If the original document contained (fired obj), this cloze test would score 3.
  
  
    We want to measure the utility of the protagonist and the narrative coherence assumption, so our baseline learns relatedness strictly based upon verb co-occurence.
    The PMI is then defined as between all occurrences of two verbs in the same document.
    This baseline evaluation is verb only, as dependencies require a protagonist to fill them.
    After initial evaluations, the baseline was performing very poorly due to the huge amount of data involved in counting all possible verb pairs (using a protagonist vastly reduces the number).
    We experimented with various count cutoffs to remo
