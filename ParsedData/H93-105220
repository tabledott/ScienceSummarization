ng verbs and adjectives.
  Models which give greater weight o immediate context would seem more appropriate in these circumstances.
  A similar experiment was applied to function words, and the dropoff beyond strictly immediate context was precipitous, converging at near chance performance for distances greater than 5.
  However, function words did appear to have pre- dictive power of roughly 5% greater than chance in directly adjacent positions.
  The effect was greatest for verbs, where the function word to the right (typically a preposition or par- ticle) served to disambiguate at a precision of 13% above chance.
  This would indicate that methods which exclude function words from models to minimize noise should con- sider their inclusion, but only for restricted local positions.
  Comparison of Sense Definitions Results for the 5 different definitions of sense ambiguity stud- ied here are similar.
  However they tend to fluctuate relative to each other across experiments, and there appears to be no consis
