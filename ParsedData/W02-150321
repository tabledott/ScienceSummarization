   These group discussions have proven particularly useful in extending grammar coverage in a parallel fashion.
    Once a consensus is reached, it is the responsibility of each grammar to make sure that its analyses match the new standard.
    As such, after each meeting, the grammar writers will rename features, change analyses, and implement new constructions into their grammars.
    Most of the basic work has now been accomplished.
    However, as the grammars expand coverage, more constructions need to be integrated into the grammars, and these constructions tend to be ones for which there is no standard analysis in the linguistic literature; so, differences can easily arise in these areas.
  
  
    The experiences of the ParGram grammar writers has shown that the parallelism of analysis and implementation in the ParGram project aids further grammar development efforts.
    Many of the basic decisions about analyses and formalism have already been made in the project.
    Thus, the grammar writer for a
