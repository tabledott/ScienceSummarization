 first element of each set is the root node, c1, and the rest are elements of the product of {c2, c3}, {c4, c5}, and {c6, c7}.
    Each set in Figure 3 corresponds to a tree in Figure 2.
    Given this formalization, the feature function for an unpacked tree is defined as follows.
    Definition 5 (Feature function for unpacked tree) The feature function fi for an unpacked tree, c E &#8486;(&#934;) is defined as: Because c E &#8486;(&#934;) corresponds to y of the conventional maximum entropy model, this function substitutes for fi(x,y) in the conventional model.
    Once a feature function for an unpacked tree is given, a model expectation is defined as in the traditional model.
    Definition 6 (Model expectation of feature forests) The model expectation &#181;i for a set of feature forests {&#934;(x)} is defined as: It is evident that the naive computation of model expectations requires exponential time complexity because the number of unpacked trees (i.e., |&#8486;(&#934;)|) is exponentially related to th
