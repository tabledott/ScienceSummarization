ufficient for building an English NP on top of two NPs separated by the Chinese conjunction AND, the composed rule r14 in Figure 1 accomplishes the same result in only one step.
    We hope that the composed rules could play in SPMT the same role that phrases play in string-based translation models.
    To test our hypothesis, we modify our rule extraction algorithm so that for every foreign phrase FZ , we extract not only a minimally syntactified, lexicalized xRS rule, but also one composed rule.
    The composed rule is obtained by extracting the rule licensed by the foreign/source phrase, alignment, English parse tree, and the first multi-child ancestor node of the root of the minimal rule.
    Our intuition is that composed rules that involve the application of more than two minimal rules are not reliable.
    For example, for the tuple in Figure 2, the composed rule that we extract given the foreign phrases AND and COMINGFROM are respectively labeled as rules r14 and r15 in Figure 1.
