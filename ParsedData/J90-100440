eature structure is made at the start of the generation process.
    Completeness is achieved by testing whether the semantics of the shadow is subsumed by the copy.
    As it stands, the generation algorithm chooses particular lexical forms on-line.
    This approach can lead to a certain amount of unnecessary nondeterminism.
    The choice of a particular form depends on the available semantic and syntactic information.
    Sometimes there is not enough information available to choose a form deterministically.
    For instance, the choice of verb form might depend on syntactic features of the verb's subject available only after the subject has been generated.
    This nondeterminism can be eliminated by deferring lexical choice to a postprocess.
    Inflectional and orthographical rules are only applied when the generation process is finished and all syntactic features are known.
    In short, the generator will yield a list of lexical items instead of a list of words.
    To this list the inflectional and
