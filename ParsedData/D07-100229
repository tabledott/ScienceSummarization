nd answers for more than half of the questions beeing asked.
			We nevertheless examine whether our model brings any performance improvements on this limited dataset which is admittedly favorable towards a FrameNetstyle analysis.
			Table 2 shows the results of our an swer extraction module (SemMatch) together with two baseline systems.
			The first baseline uses only dependency relation path information (SynMatch),whereas the second baseline (SemParse) uses Shal maneser, a state-of-the-art shallow semantic parser for the role labeling task.
			We consider an answer correct if it is returned with rank 1.
			As can be seen,SemMatch is significantly better than both SynMatch and SemParse, whereas the latter is signifi cantly worse than SynMatch.
			Although promising, the results in Table 2 are not very informative, since they show performance gainson partial data.
			Instead of using our answer extrac tion model on its own, we next combined it with the syntax-based system mentioned above (SynMatch, see also Se
