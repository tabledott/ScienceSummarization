ny way as to their position in the sequence of argu ments, or even the quantity.
			We therefore decided touse this strategy only for the CORE ARGUMENTS.
			Although, there was an increase in F1 score when the lan guage model probabilities were jointly estimated over allthe predicates, this improvement is not statistically significant.
			However, estimating the same using specific predicate lemmas, showed a significant improvement in accu racy.
			The performance improvement is shown in Table 5.
	
	
			The best system is trained by first filtering the mostlikely nulls using the best NULL vs NON-NULL classifier trained using all the features whose argument identi fication F1 score is marked in bold in Table 4, and thentraining a ONE vs ALL classifier using the data remain ing after performing the filtering and using the features that contribute positively to the classification task ? ones whose accuracies are marked in bold in Table 4.
			Table 6 shows the performance of this system.
