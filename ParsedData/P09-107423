that involve string matching.
    Similarly, we partition pronominal anaphora into several subcategories that we expect may behave differently.
    We define the following nine resolution classes: Proper Names: Three resolution classes cover CEs that are named entities (e.g. the PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION and DATE classes for MUC and ACE) and have a prior referent7 in the text.
    These three classes are distinguished by the type of antecedent that can be resolved against the proper name.
    Common NPs: Three analogous string match classes cover CEs that have a common noun as a head: (4) CN-e (5) CN-p (6) CN-n. As noted above, resolution classes are defined for annotated CEs.
    We use the twin relationship to match extracted CEs to annotated CEs and to evaluate performance on each resolution class.
    To score each resolution class separately, we define a new variant of the MUC scorer.
    We compute a MUC-RC score (for MUC Resolution Class) for class C as follows: we assume that all CEs that do not
