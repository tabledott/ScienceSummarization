he results are not directly comparable as they did not use actual input words, but rather recreated input words from the regenerated tokens in the ATB.
    Sometimes this can simplify the analysis: for example, a p (ta marbuta) must be word-final in Arabic orthography, and thus a word-medial p in a recreated input word reliably signals a token boundary.
    The rather high baseline shows that tokenization is not a hard problem.
  
  
    The POS tagset Diab et al. (2004) use is a subset of the tagset for English that was introduced with the English Penn Treebank.
    The large set of Arabic tags has been mapped (by the Linguistic Data Consortium) to this smaller English set, and the meaning of the English tags has changed.
    We consider this tagset unmotivated, as it makes morphological distinctions because they are marked in English, not Arabic.
    The morphological distinctions that the English tagset captures represent the complete morphological variation that can be found in English.
    However, in Ar
