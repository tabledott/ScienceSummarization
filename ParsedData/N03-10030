  Learning To Paraphrase: An Unsupervised Approach Using Multiple-Sequence Alignment
  
    We address the text-to-text generation problem of sentence-level paraphrasing &#8212; a phenomenon distinct from and more difficult than wordor phrase-level paraphrasing.
    Our apapplies alignment sentences gathered from unannotated comparable corpora: it learns a set of paraphrasing patrepresented by lattice and automatically determines how to apply these patterns to rewrite new sentences.
    The results of our evaluation experiments show that the system derives accurate paraphrases, outperforming baseline systems.
  
  
    This is a late parrot!
    It&#8217;s a stiff!
    Bereft of life, it rests in peace!
    If you hadn&#8217;t nailed him to the perch he would be pushing up the daisies!
