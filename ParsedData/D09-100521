; values obtained by first running INSIDE(HG, K) and OUTSIDE(HG, K), which use only the ke part of the weights and ignore the more expensive xe.
    It is noteworthy that the expectation semiring is not used at all by Figure 4.
    Although the return value (&#710;k, &#710;x) is in the expectation semiring, it is built up not by &#174; and &#174; but rather by computing k&#710; and x&#710; separately.
    One might therefore wonder why the expectation semiring and its operations are still needed.
    One reason is that the input to Figure 4 consists of hyperedge weights (ke, xe) in the expectation semiring&#8212;and these weights may well have been constructed using &#174; and &#174;.
    For example, Eisner (2002) uses finite-state operations such as composition, which do combine weights entirely within the expectation semiring before their result is passed to the forward-backward algorithm.
    A second reason is that when we work with a second-order expectation semiring in Section 4.4 below, the &#710;k, &
