ent of a system of mappings.
    In CorMet, systematicity measures a metaphorical mapping&#8217;s tendency to co-occur with other mappings.
    The systematicity score for a mapping X is defined as the number of strong, distinct mappings co-occurring with X.
    This measure goes only a little way toward capturing the extent to which a metaphor exhibits the structure described in the thematic-relations hypothesis, but extending CorMet to find the entities that correspond to objects, locations, and paths is beyond the scope of this article.
    CorMet computes a confidence measure for each metaphor it discovers.
    Confidence is a function of three things.
    The more verbs mediating a metaphor (as attack and assault mediate ENEMY &#8594; DISEASE in The antigen attacked the virus and Chemotherapy assaults the tumor), the more credible it is.
    Strongly unidirectional structure flow from source domain to target makes a mapping more credible.
    Finally, a mapping is more likely to be correct if it systemat
