ically co-occurs with other mappings.
    The confidence measure should not be interpreted as a probability of correctness: The data available for calibrating such a distribution are inadequate.
    The weights of each factor, empirically assigned plausible values, are given in Table 3.
    The confidence measure is intended to wrap all the available evidence about a metaphor&#8217;s credibility into one number.
    A principled way of doing this is desirable, but unfortunately there are not enough data to make meaningful use of machinelearning techniques to find the best set of components and weights.
    There is substantial arbitrariness in the confidence rating: The components used and the weights they are assigned could easily be different and are best considered guesses that give reasonable results.
