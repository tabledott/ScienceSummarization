    The assertion of semantic information was noted by Lees (1960) in the formation of noun phrases and later developed by Katz (1964) as the process of &amp;quot;attribution.&amp;quot; Assertions contain information that is possessed by senses of lexical items of certain parts of speech and that is imposed onto senses of lexical items of other parts of speech, e.g., the adjective 'female' contains information that any noun to which it applies is of the female sex.
    Lexical syntactic and semantic constraints are enforced at certain places in sentences which I call dependencies.
    Within a dependency, the lexical item whose constraints are enforced is called the source and the other lexical item
