 Markov assumption can be made for sequential classification problems in order to ensure tractable learning and inference.
    Klein and Manning (2003) distinguish between two kinds of Markovization for unlexicalized CFG parsing.
    The first is vertical Markovization, which makes the generation of a non-terminal dependent on other non-terminals that have been generated at different levels in the phrase-structure tree.
    The second is horizontal Markovization, which makes the generation of a non-terminal dependent on other non-terminals that have been generated at the same level in the tree.
    For dependency parsing there are analogous notions of vertical and horizontal Markovization for a given edge (i, j)k. First, let us define the vertical and horizontal neighbourhoods of (i, j)k. The vertical neighbourhood includes all edges in any path from the root to a leaf that passes through (i, j)k. The horizontal neighbourhood contains all edges (i, j')k&#65533;.
