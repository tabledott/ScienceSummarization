Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a broad-coverage machine-readable dictionary which includes 11,306 verbs mapped to 13,508 word senses, called synsets, and 114,648 common and proper nouns mapped to 79,689 synsets.
    Each noun or verb synset is associated with one of 41 broad semantic categories, in order to organize the lexicographer&#8217;s work of updating and managing the lexicon (see Table 1).
    Since each lexicographer category groups together many synsets they have been also called supersenses (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003).
    There are 26 supersenses for nouns, 15 for verbs.
    This coarse-grained ontology has a number of attractive features, for the purpose of natural language processing.
    First, the small size of the set makes it possible to build a single tagger which has positive consequences on robustness.
    Second, classes, although fairly general, are easily recognizable and not too abstract or vague.
    More importantly, similar word senses tend to be merged together.
