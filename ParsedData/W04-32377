Ent models, as presented in (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000).
    We are not aware of any previous work on MAP adaptation of MaxEnt models using a prior, be it Gaussian or a different one, such as the exponential prior of (Goodman, 2004).
    Although we do not have a formal derivation, the adaptation technique should easily extend to the CRF scenario.
    A final remark contrasts rule-based approaches to sequence tagging such as (Brill, 1994) with the probabilistic approach taken in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996): having a weight on each feature in the MaxEnt model and a sound probabilistic model allows for a principled way of adapting the model to a new domain; performing such adaptation in a rule-based model is unclear, if at all possible.
  
  
    A simple approach to sequence labeling is the maximum entropy Markov model.
    The model assigns a probability P(T|W) to any possible tag sequence model is built.
    The approach we took is the one in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), which uses xi(W, T i&#8722;1 1 ) = {wi, wi&#8722;1, wi
