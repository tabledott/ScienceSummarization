 by a single token, the text is converted to lower case, and the morphology database is used to find the base forms of the verbs and nouns.
    The extracted head word tuples differ from the training data used in previous supervised attempts in an important way.
    In the supervised case, both of the potential sites, namely the verb v and the noun n are known before the attachment is resolved.
    In the unsupervised case discussed here, the extraction heuristic only finds what it thinks are unambiguous cases of prepositional phrase attachment.
    Therefore, there is only one possible attachment site for the preposition, and either the verb v or the noun n does not exist, in the case of noun-attached preposition or a verb-attached preposition, respectively.
    This extraction heuristic loosely resembles a step in the bootstrapping procedure used to get training data for the classifier of (Hindle and Rooth, 1993).
    In that step, unambiguous attachments from the FIDDITCH parser's output are initially used
