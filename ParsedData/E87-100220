    Consider the following pair of frame schemata, in and arbitrary consonant: [c] [1 [1 First of these the one that was used for the consonants in the above example except in the situation for the first occurrence of &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, where is was being spread into the final two consonantal positions of the form.
    The second frame differs from this is two respects.
    First, the prosodic template contains the hitherto unused symbol &amp;quot;G&amp;quot;. for &amp;quot;geminate&amp;quot;, and second, the root tape is not advanced.
    Suppose, now, that the the prosodic template for forms like &amp;quot;kattab&amp;quot; is not &amp;quot;CVCCVC&amp;quot;, but &amp;quot;CVGCVC&amp;quot;.
    It will be possible to discharge the &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; only if the root template does not advance, so that the following &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; in the template can only cause the same consonant to be into the word time.
    The sequence &amp;quot;GC&amp;quot; in a prosodic template is therefore an idiom for c
