sentative of model performance and are selected to illustrate the range of encountered phenomena.
  All system evaluation is based on the task of selecting the correct root for a given inflection (which has a long lexicography-based consensus regarding the ?truth?).
  In contrast, the descriptive analysis of any such pairing is very theory dependent without standard consensus.
  The ?TopBridge?
  column shows the strongest English bridge lemma utilized in mapping (typically one of many potential bridge lemmas).
  These results are quite impressive in that they are based on essen- tially no language-specific knowledge of French, Spanish or Czech.
  In addition, the multilingual bridge algorithm is surface-form in- dependent, and can just as readily handle obscure infixational or reduplicative morphological processes.
  CONCLUSION This paper has presented a detailed survey of original algorithms for cross-language annotation projection and noise-robust tagger induction, evaluated on four diverse applications.
