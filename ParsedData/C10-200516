 is different between the two tasks.
			For subjectivity detection, the top-5 features in terms of information gain, based on the training data, are: negative polarity, positive polarity, verbs, good emoticons and upper case.
			For this task, the meta-information of the words (negative polarity, positive polarity and verbs) is more important than specific features from Twitter (good emoticons and upper case), whereas for the subjectivity detection, tweet syntax features have a higher relevance.
			This analysis show that prior polarity is very important for this task.
			However, one limitation of using it from a generic list is its values might not hold for some specific scenario.
			For instance,the polarity of the word ?spot?
			is positive accord ing to this list.
			However, looking at our training data almost half of the occurrences of this word appears in the positive set and the other half inthe negative set.
			Thus, it is not correct to as sume that prior polarity of ?spot?
			is 1 for thisparticul
