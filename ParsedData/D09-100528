   From Expectations to Gradients One perspective is that our fundamentally finds expectations.
    Thus, we must be finding VZ by formulating it as a certain expectation r. Specifto be rsT, a matrix.
    However, when using this semiring to compute second derivatives (Case 2) or covariances, one may exploit the invariant that r = s, e.g., to avoid storing s and to pere Vpe pere. def where pe =exp(re&#183; models, that V log Z = (VZ)/Z = &#175;r/Z, the vector of feature expectations (Lau et al., 1993).
  
  
    Given a hypergraph HG whose hyperedges e are annotated with values pe.
    Recall from Section 3.1 that this defines a probability distribution over all derivations d in the hypergraph, namely p(d)/Z where p(d) def = 11eEd pe.
    In Section 3, we show how to compute the expected hypothesis length or expected feature counts, using the algorithm of Figure 2 with a first-order expectation semiring ER,R.
    In general, given hyperedge weights (pe, pere), the algorithm computes (Z, r) and thus r/Z, the e
