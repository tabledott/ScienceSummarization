    To avoid redundant statements in a summary, we could select one sentence from the set of similar sentences that meets some criteria (e.g., a threshold number of common content words).
    Unfortunately, any representative sentence usually includes embedded phrases containing information that is not common to other similar sentences.
    Therefore, we need to intersect the theme sentences to identify the common phrases and then generate a new sentence.
    Phrases produced by theme intersection will form the content of the generated summary.
