s, such as CLANG, whose syntax doesnot strictly follow a nested set of predicates and ar guments, some final minor syntactic adjustment of the final MR may be needed.
			In the example, thefinal MR is (bowner (player our f2g)).
			In the fol lowing discussion, we ignore the difference between these two.There are a few complications left which re quire special handling when generating MR?s,like coordination, anaphora resolution and noncompositionality exceptions.
			Due to space limitations, we do not present the straightforward tech niques we used to handle them.
	
	
			This section discusses how sentences for training SCISSOR were manually annotated with SAPT?s. Sentences were parsed by Collins?
			head-driven model 2 (Bikel, 2004) (trained on sections 02-21 of the WSJ Penn Treebank) to generate an initial syntactic parse tree.
			The trees were then manually corrected and each node augmented with a semantic label.
			First, semantic labels for individual words, called semantic tags, are added to the POS nod
