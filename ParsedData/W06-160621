 experiment were instructed to carefully read the three reference translations and seven machine translation outputs, and assign a score between 1 and 5 to each translation output on the basis of its quality.
    Human judges were told that the translation quality assessment should take into consideration both the grammatical iuency of the outputs and their translation adequacy.
    Table 2 shows the average scores obtained by each system according to each judge.
    For convenience, the table also shows the Bleu scores of all systems (including the human translations) on three reference translations.
    The results in Table 2 show that the human judges are remarkably consistent in preferring the syntax-based outputs over the phrase-based outputs.
    On a 1 to 5 quality scale, the difference between the phrase-based and syntax-based systems was, on average, between 0.2 and 0.3 points.
    All differences between the phrase-based baseline and the syntax-based outputs were statistically significant.
