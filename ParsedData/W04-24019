near (in)equalities over V. We exemplify the framework using the problem of simultaneous recognition of named entities and relations in sentences.
    Briefly speaking, we assume a learning mechanism that can recognize entity phrases in sentences, based on local contextual features.
    Similarly, we assume a learning mechanism that can recognize the semantic relation between two given phrases in a sentence.
    We seek an inference algorithm that can produce a coherent labeling of entities and relations in a given sentence.
    Furthermore, it follows, as best as possible the recommendation of the entity and relation classifiers, but also satisfies natural constraints that exist on whether specific entities can be the argument of specific relations, whether two relations can occur together at the same time, or any other information that might be available at the inference time (e.g., suppose it is known that entities A and B represent the same location; one may like to incorporate an additional constraint th
