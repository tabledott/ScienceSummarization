rrounding the string in the sentence in which it appears (e.g., a rule that any proper name modified by an appositive whose head is president is a person).
    The task can be considered to be one component of the MUC (MUC-6, 1995) named entity task (the other task is that of segmentation, i.e., pulling possible people, places and locations from text before sending them to the classifier).
    Supervised methods have been applied quite successfully to the full MUC named-entity task (Bikel et al. 97).
    At first glance, the problem seems quite complex: a large number of rules is needed to cover the domain, suggesting that a large number of labeled examples is required to train an accurate classifier.
    But we will show that the use of unlabeled data can drastically reduce the need for supervision.
    Given around 90,000 unlabeled examples, the methods described in this paper classify names with over 91% accuracy.
    The only supervision is in the form of 7 seed rules (namely, that New York, California an
