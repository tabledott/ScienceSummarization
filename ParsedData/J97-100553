omena or a well-defined decision procedure, one can expect good interrater reliability among different coders (see Duncan and Fiske [1977] and Mokros [1984]).
    The coref feature falls into this category.
    In addition, preliminary data from a third coder provides good evidence that coref can be coded reliably.
    A feasibility study of the parsers CASS (Abney 1990) and FIDDITCH (Hindle 1983) showed that coding FICUs on this data could be automated.'
    Subjectivity in coding the infer feature was eliminated by providing operational definitions of a small set of types of inferential links, also fully documented in Passonneau (1994), where infer occurs only if one or more of the bridging inferences occurs.
    4.1.3 Evaluation.
    The segmentation algorithms presented in Section 4.2 are evaluated by quantifying their performance in segmenting a test set of 10 narratives from our corpus.
    As discussed above, there is no training data for the algorithms in this section, which are derived from the liter
