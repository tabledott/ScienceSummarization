on.
			Table 2 shows the results.
			The columns are our editing distance based evaluation measure.
			Test set S3566 has a higher score for all algorithms because it has a higher number of average features per word than S13403.
			For the K-means and Buckshot algorithms, we set the number of clusters to 250 and the maximum number of iterations to 8.
			We used a sample size of 2000 for Buckshot.
			For the Bisecting K-means algorithm, we applied the basic K-means algorithm twice (?
			= 2 in Section 2) with a maximum of 8 iterations per split.
			Our implementation of Chameleon was unable to complete clustering S13403 in reasonable time due to its time complexity.
			Table 2 shows that K-means, Buckshot and Average-link have very similar performance.
			CBC outperforms all other algorithms on both data sets.

			Let c be a cluster and wn(c) be the WordNet class that has the largest intersection with c. The precision of c is defined as: Table 1.
