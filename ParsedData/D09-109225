nts that are topically similar but are not direct translations of one another &#8211; considerably more abundant than true parallel corpora.
    In this section, we explore two questions relating to comparable text corpora and polylingual topic modeling.
    First, we explore whether comparable document tuples support the alignment of fine-grained topics, as demonstrated earlier using parallel documents.
    This property is useful for building machine translation systems as well as for human readers who are either learning new languages or analyzing texts in languages they do not know.
    Second, because comparable texts may not use exactly the same topics, it becomes crucially important to be able to characterize differences in topic prevalence at the document level (do different languages have different perspectives on the same article?) and at the language-wide level (which topics do particular languages focus on?).
    We downloaded XML copies of all Wikipedia articles in twelve different languages: Wel
