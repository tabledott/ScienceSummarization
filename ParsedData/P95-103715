    The word feature can take on any value of any word.
    The tag feature can take on any value in the part-of-speech tag set.
    The label feature can take on any value in the non-terminal set.
    The extension can take on any of the following five values: right - the node is the first child of a constituent; left - the node is the last child of a constituent; up - the node is neither the first nor the last child of a constituent; unary - the node is a child of a unary constituent; root - the node is the root of the tree.
    For an n word sentence, a parse tree has n leaf nodes, where the word feature value of the ith leaf node is the ith word in the sentence.
