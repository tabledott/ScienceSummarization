nvestigated a number of supervised machine learning methods that produce automatic classifiers (decision tree induction, rule learning, and two types of neural networks), as well as hierarchical clustering; see Stevenson et al. (1999) for more detail.
    Because we achieved approximately the same level of performance in all cases, we narrowed our further experimentation to the publicly available version of the C5.0 machine learning system (http://www.rulequest.com), a newer version of C4.5 (Quinlan 1992), due to its ease of use and wide availability.
    The C5.0 system generates both decision trees and corresponding rule sets from a training set of known classifications.
    In our experiments, we found little to no difference in performance between the trees and rule sets, and report only the rule set results.
    In the experiments below, we follow two methodologies in training and testing, each of which tests a subset of cases held out from the training data.
    Thus, in all cases, the results we report
