 conventional parser and to have the analyst select the correct parse from the set returned (or reject them all).
    However, this approach places a great load on the analyst, who will routinely need to examine large numbers of parses for given sentences.
    In addition, computation of all possible analyses is likely to be expensive and, in the limit, intractable.
    Briscoe (1987) demonstrates that the structure of the search space in parse derivations makes a left-to-right, incremental mode of parse selection most efficient.
    For example, in noun compounds analyzed using a recursive binary-branching rule (N N N) the number of analyses correlates with the Catalan series (Church and Patil, 1982), so a 3-word compound has 2 analyses, 4 has 5, 5 has 14, 9 has 1430, and so forth.
    However, Briscoe (1987:154f) shows that with a simple bounded context parser (with one word lookahead) set up to request help whenever a parse indeterminacy arises, it is possible to select any of the 14 analyses of a 5-word c
