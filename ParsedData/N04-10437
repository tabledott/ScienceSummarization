e-model perplexity of the unsupervised corpus.
    In practice, we observed no significant differences in accuracy when using one or the other in our experiments.
    All experimental results given in this paper are with the Spatter clustering algorithm.
    The result of running the clustering algorithm is a binary tree, where each word occupies a single leaf node, and where each leaf node contains a single word.
    The root node defines a cluster containing the entire vocabulary.
    Interior nodes represent intermediate size clusters containing all of the words that they dominate.
    Thus, nodes higher in the tree correspond to larger word clusters, while lower nodes correspond to smaller clusters.
    A particular word can be assigned a binary string by following the traversal path from the root to its leaf, assigning a 0 for each left branch, and a 1 for each right branch.
    The following are example bit strings from the Spatter clustering algorithm:
