zed as uniform disdard applications of log-linear models apply con ditional maximum likelihood estimation, which for our case involves using an empirical distribution p?over question-answer pairs (and their trees) to opti mize as follows: max ? ?
			q,?q,a,?a p?(q, ?q,a, ?a) log p?(q, ?q | a, ?a) ? ??
			P x p?(q,?q,x|a,?a) (8) Note the hidden variable x being summed out; that makes the optimization problem non-convex.
			Thissort of problem can be solved in principle by conditional variants of the Expectation-Maximization al gorithm (Baum et al, 1970; Dempster et al, 1977; Meng and Rubin, 1993; Jebara and Pentland, 1999).
			We use a quasi-Newton method known as L-BFGS(Liu and Nocedal, 1989) that makes use of the gradient of the above function (straightforward to com pute, but omitted for space).
	
	
			To evaluate our model, we conducted experiments using Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 8?13 QA dataset.8 5.1 Experimental Setup.
			The TREC dataset contains questions and answer patterns, as well as a pool o
