tasks different classifiers perform at similar levels of accuracy, we have observed a dramatic difference between using support vector machines and a memory-based learner.
    Although the reasons for such a large disparity in results is currently the subject of further investigation, we speculate that a relatively small difference in initial classifier accuracy results in larger differences in parser performance, due to the deterministic nature of the parser (certain errors may lead to further errors).
    We also believe classifier choice to be one major source of the difference in accuracy between Nivre and Scholz&#8217;s parser and Yamada and Matsumoto&#8217;s parser.
    While the accuracy of SVMpar is below that of lexicalized PCFG-based statistical parsers, it is surprisingly good for a greedy parser that runs in linear time.
    Additionally, it is considerably faster than lexicalized PCFG-based parsers, and offers a good alternative for when fast parsing is needed.
    MBLpar, on the other hand, perf
