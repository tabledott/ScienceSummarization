es of unary projections, which usually correspond to different X-bar levels associated with the anchor.
    The operations used to combine spines are similar to the TAG operations of adjunction and sister adjunction.
    We will call these operations regular adjunction (r-adjunction) and sister adjunction (s-adjunction).
    As one example, the cake spine shown above can be s-adjoined into the VP node of the ate spine, to form the tree shown in figure 1(a).
    In contrast, if we use the r-adjunction operation to adjoin the cake tree into the VP node, we get a different structure, which has an additional VP level created by the r-adjunction operation: the resulting tree is shown in figure 1(b).
    The r-adjunction operation is similar to the usual adjunction operation in TAGs, but has some differences that allow our grammars to be splittable; see section 2.3 for more discussion.
    We now give formal definitions of the sets E and D. Take x to be a sentence consisting of n + 1 words, x0 ... xn, where x0 is a
