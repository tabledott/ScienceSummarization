odels.
			If we compare the labeled attachmentscore to the prediction accuracy (which also takes depen dency types into account), we observe a substantial drop (from 89.7 to 81.7 for the lexical model, from 87.4 to 76.5 for the non-lexical model), which is of course onlyto be expected.
			The unlabeled attachment score is naturally higher, and it is worth noting that the relative differ ence between the MBL lexical model and the other twomodels is much smaller.
			This indicates that the advan tage of the lexical model mainly concerns the accuracy in predicting dependency type in addition to transition.
