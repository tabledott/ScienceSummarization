ted us to devise more reliable measures based on basic similarities.
    BM25 measures the similarity between two bags of words.
    It is not sensitive to differences in the order of sentences between two articles.
    To remedy this, we define a measure that uses the similarities in sentence alignments in the article alignment.
    We define AVSIM(J, E) as the similarity between Japanese article, J, and English article, E: where (J1, E1), (J2, E2),... (Jm, Em) are the sentence alignments obtained by the method described in Section 3.2.

    Our sentence alignment program aligns sentences accurately if the English sentences are literal translations of the Japanese as discussed in Section 3.2.
    However, the relation between English news sentences and Japanese news sentences ar
