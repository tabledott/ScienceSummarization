ble symbols without changing the meaning of the rule.
    Thus, the matrix [+consonantal] can be translated to the regular language {p, t, k, b, d... } and treated with standard techniques.
    Of course, if the features are incompatible, the feature matrix will be replaced by the empty set of segments.
    A simple translation is also available for feature variables all of whose occurrences are located in just one part of the rule, as in the following fictitious left context: [ ahigh [ +consonantal ]* [ -around ] If a takes on the value +, then the first matrix is instantiated to [+highl and denotes the set of unanalyzable symbols, say {e, 1, that satisfy that description.
    The last matrix reduces to [-round] and denotes another set of unanalyzable symbols (e.g.
    { a, e, }).
    The whole expression is then equivalent to { e, } {p, t, k, b, d }* {a, e, } On the other hand, if a takes on the value -, then the first matrix is instantiated to [-high] and denotes a different set of symbols, say {a, o... },
