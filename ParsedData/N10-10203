upervised conversation models, where the discovery of acts amounts to clustering utterances with similar conversational roles.
    This avoids manual construction of an act inventory, and allows the learning algorithm to tell us something about how people converse in a new medium.
    There is surprisingly little work in unsupervised dialogue act tagging.
    Woszczyna and Waibel (1994) propose an unsupervised Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for dialogue structure in a meeting scheduling domain, but model dialogue state at the word level.
    Crook et al. (2009) use Dirichlet process mixture models to cluster utterances into a flexible number of acts in a travel-planning domain, but do not examine the sequential structure of dialogue.2 In contrast to previous work, we address the problem of discovering dialogue acts in an informal, open-topic domain, where an unsupervised learner may be distracted by strong topic clusters.
    We also train and test our models in a new medium: Twitter.
    Rather than test against
