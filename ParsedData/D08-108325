n et al. (2005) also manually collected a handful of content-word negators (referred as &#8220;general polarity shifters&#8221;), but not extensively.
    Moilanen and Pulman (2007) collected a more extensive set of negators semi-automatically using WordNet 2.1, but the empirical effect of such words was not explicitly investigated.
  
  
    In this paper, we consider the task of determining the polarity of a sentiment-bearing expression, considering the effect of interactions among words or constituents in light of compositional semantics.
    We presented a novel learning-based approach that incorporates structural inference motivated by compositional semantics into the learning procedure.
    Our approach can be considered as a small step toward bridging the gap between computational semantics and machine learning methods.
    Our experimental results suggest that this direction of research is promising.
    Future research includes an approach that learns the compositional inference rules from data.
