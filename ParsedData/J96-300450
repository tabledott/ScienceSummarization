iwan (T1&#8211;T3), and three from the Mainland (M1&#8211;M3)&#8212;to segment the corpus.
    Since we could not bias the subjects towards a particular segmentation and did not presume linguistic sophistication on their part, the instructions were simple: subjects were to mark all places they might plausibly pause if they were reading the text aloud.
    An examination of the subjects' bracketings confirmed that these instructions were satisfactory in yielding plausible word-sized units.
    (See also Wu and Fung [1994].)
    Various segmentation approaches were then compared with human performance: Clearly, for judges Ji and 12, taking Ji as standard and computing the precision and recall for 12 yields the same results as taking 12 as the standard, and computing for respectively, the recall and precision.
    We therefore used the arithmetic mean of each interjudge precision-recall pair as a single measure of interjudge similarity.
    Table 2 shows these similarity measures.
    The average agreement among
