interesting to note that the semantic frames are a helpful way of generalizing between predicates; words in the same frame have been found frequently to share the same syntactic argument structure.
    A more complete description of the FrameNet project can be found in (Baker et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 2001), and the ramifications for automatic classification are discussed more thoroughly in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
    The philosophy of the Propbank project can be likened to FrameNet without frames.
    While the semantic roles of FrameNet are defined at the level of the frame, in Propbank, roles are defined on a per-predicate basis.
    The core arguments of each predicate are simply numbered, while remaining arguments are given labels such as &amp;quot;temporal&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;locative&amp;quot;.
    While the two types of label names are reminiscent of the traditional argument/adjunct distinction, this is primarily as a convenience in defining roles, and no claims are intended as to optional
