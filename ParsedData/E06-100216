			If f(w) is the frequency ofword w in document d, and N is the total num ber of Wikipedia articles, then the weight of word w2V in the tf  idf representation of d is: d w = f(w) ln N df(w) (2) 4.2 Taxonomy Kernel.
			An error analysis of the cosine-based ranking method reveals that, in many cases, the pair hq; ei fails to rank first, even though words from thequery context unambiguously indicate e as the ac tual denoted entity.
			In these cases, cue words from the context do not appear in e?s article due to two main reasons: 1.
			The article may be too short or incomplete..
			2.
			Even though the article captures most of the.
			relevant concepts expressed in the query con text, it does this by employing synonymous words or phrases.
			The cosine similarity between q and e k can be seen as an expression of the total degree of correlation between words from the context of query q and a given named entity e k . When the correlation is t
