lause is removed&amp;quot; I &amp;quot;v=give&amp;quot;), or the probability that the to-infinitive modifier of the head noun &amp;quot;device&amp;quot; is removed, represented as Prob(&amp;quot;to-infinitive modifier is removed&amp;quot; I&amp;quot;n=device&amp;quot;).
    These probabilities are computed using Bayes's rule.
    For example, the probability that the &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; temporal clause is removed when the main verb is &amp;quot;give&amp;quot;, Prob(&amp;quot;when-clause is removed&amp;quot; I &amp;quot;v=give&amp;quot;), is computed as the product of Prob( &amp;quot;v=give&amp;quot; I &amp;quot;when-clause is removed&amp;quot;) (i.e., the probability that the main verb is &amp;quot;give&amp;quot; when the &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; clause is removed) and Prob(&amp;quot;when-clause is removed&amp;quot;) (i.e., the probability that the &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; clause is removed), divided by Prob(&amp;quot;v=give&amp;quot;) (i.e., the probability that the main verb is &amp;quot;give&amp;quot;
