tems become more oriented towards solving real-world problems like machine translation or spoken language understanding in a limited domain, their need for access to vast amounts of knowledge increases.
    While a model of the general rules of the language at various levels (morphological, syntactic, etc.) can be hand-encoded, knowledge which pertains to each specific word is harder to encode manually, if only because of the size of the lexicon.
    Most systems currently rely on human linguists or lexicographers who compile lexicon entries by hand.
    This approach requires significant amounts of time and effort for expanding the system's lexicon.
    Furthermore, if the compiled information depends in any way on the domain of the application, the acquisition of lexical knowledge must be repeated whenever the system is transported to another domain.
    For systems which need access to large lexicons, some form of at least partial automation of the lexical knowledge acquisition phase is needed.
