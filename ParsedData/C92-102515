el transducers of Koskenniemis two- level model [1].
  In recent times the two- level model has been more popular.
  It has turned out (Karttunen [10]) that parallel two-level constraints are even expressive enough to account for phenomena that require rule order ing in the classical phonological rule formalism.
  But there is no computational or theoretical reason to insist on two-level descriptions.
  Because the mathematical properties of rewrite and two-level rules are now well-understood (Kaplan [9], Ritchie [11]), we can compose any n-level description to just two levels.
  In our work on English and French mor- phology we came across many instances in which the introduction of an extra level is both practical and linguistically motivated.
  The case of French compound plurals is a typical example.
  Our success in composing the rule sys- tem with the lexicon (Stage 4 in Figure 8) is due to a number of fortunate characteris- tics that morphological alternations and lexicons of natural anguages eem to ha
