 a natural language understanding task and successfully applied to statistical machine translation by (Och and Ney, 2002).
    We obtain the following decision rule: Typically, the source language sentence e and the target sentence f are the fundamental knowledge sources for the task of finding word alignments.
    Linguistic data, which can be used to identify associations between lexical items are often ignored by traditional word alignment approaches.
    Linguistic tools such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers, namedentity recognizers have become more and more robust and available for many languages by now.
    It is important to make use of linguistic information to improve alignment strategies.
    Treated as feature functions, syntactic dependencies can be easily incorporated into log-linear models.
    In order to incorporate a new dependency which contains extra information other than the bilingual sentence pair, we modify Eq.2 by adding a new variable v: Note that our log-linear models are different
