dentifying sentence boundaries.
    The most recent work will be described in (Palmer and Hearst, To appear).
    There is also a less detailed description of Palmer and Hearst's system, SATZ, in (Palmer and Hearst, 1994).'
    The SATZ architecture uses either a decision tree or a neural network to disambiguate sentence boundaries.
    The neural network achieves 98.5% accuracy on a corpus of Wall Street Journal We recommend these articles for a more comprehensive review of sentence-boundary identification work than we will be able to provide here. articles using a lexicon which includes part-of-speech (POS) tag information.
    By increasing the quantity ol training data and decreasing the size of their test corpus, Palmer and Hearst achieved performance of !
    )8.9% with the neural network.
    They obtained similar results using the decision tree.
    All the results we will present for our algorithms are on their initial, larger test corpus.
    In (Riley, 1989), Riley describes a decision-tree based a
