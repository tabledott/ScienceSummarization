t always turns out that exactly one parse in each class satisfies the following simple declarative constraints: The notation here is from (4).
    More colloquially, (7) says that the output of rightward (leftward) composition may not compose or apply over anything to is right (left).
    A parse tree or subtree that satisfies (7) is said to be in normal form (NF).
    As an example, consider the effect of these restrictions on the simple sentence &amp;quot;John likes Mary.&amp;quot; Ignoring the tags &#8212;OT, &#8212;FC, and &#8212;BC for the moment, (8a) is a normal-form parse.
    Its competitor (813) is not, nor is any larger tree containing (8b).
    But non3How inefficient?
    (i) has exponentially many semantically distinct parses: n = 10 yields 82,756,612 parses in (2&#176;) = 48,620 equivalence classes.
    Karttunen's io method must therefore add 48,620 representative parses to the appropriate chart cell, first comparing each one against all the previously added parses&#8212;of which there are 48,
