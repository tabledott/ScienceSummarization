s.
    Prefix, suffix, prefix-suffix likelihood score to further filter out illegitimate stem candidates was set at 0.5 for the segmenters developed from 10K, 20K, and 40K manually segmented corpora, whereas it was set at 0.85 for the segmenters developed from a 110K manually segmented corpus.
    Both the frequency threshold and the optimal prefix, suffix, prefix-suffix likelihood scores were determined on empirical grounds.
    Contextual Filter stated in (8) has been applied only to the segmenter developed from 110K manually segmented training corpus.5 Comparison of Tables 5 and 6 indicates a high correlation between the segmentation error rate and the unknown stem ratio.
    Table 7 gives the error analyses of four segmenters according to three factors: (i) errors due to unknown stems, (ii) errors involving &#1605;&#65262;&#65268;&#1127;&#65247;&#1575; (Alywm), and (iii) errors due to other factors.
    Interestingly, the segmenter developed from a 110K manually segmented corpus has the lowest percentage
