 productions, collapsing singleton productions, and converting n-ary productions (n &gt; 2) as in figure 3.
    The resulting trees were treated as the &amp;quot;Correct&amp;quot; trees in the evaluation.
    Only trees with forty or fewer symbols were used in this experiment.
    A grammar was then induced in a straightforward way from these trees, simply by giving one count for each observed production.
    No smoothing was done.
    There were 1805 sentences and 38610 nonterminals in the test data.
  
  
    Table 2 shows the results of running all three algorithms, evaluating against five criteria.
    Notice that for each algorithm, for the criterion that it optimizes it is the best algorithm.
    That is, the Labelled Tree Algorithm is the best for the Labelled Tree Rate, the Labelled Recall Algorithm is the best for the Labelled Recall Rate, and the Bracketed Recall Algorithm is the best for the Bracketed Recall Rate.
  
  
    Matching parsing algorithms to evaluation criteria is a powerful technique
