uses the knowledge in a LKB (based on WordNet) in order to perform unsupervised Word Sense Disambuation.
    Our algorithm uses the full graph of the LKB efficiently, performing better than previous approaches in English all-words datasets.
    We also show that the algorithm can be easily ported to other languages with good results, with the only requirement of having a wordnet.
    Both for Spanish and English the algorithm attains performances close to the MFS.
    The algorithm is publicly available5 and can be applied easily to sense inventories and knowledge bases different from WordNet.
    Our analysis shows that our algorithm is efficient compared to previously proposed alternatives, and that a good choice of WordNet versions and relations is fundamental for good performance.
