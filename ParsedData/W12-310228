shown in Table 7 for translations into English, and Table 8 out of English, sorted by average correlation across the language pairs.
    The highest correlation for each language pair and the highest overall average are bolded.
    Once again this year, many of the metrics had stronger correlation with human judgments than BLEU.
    The metrics that had the strongest correlation this year were SEMPOS for the into English direction and SIMPBLEU for the out of English direction.
    We measured the metrics&#8217; segment-level scores with the human rankings using Kendall&#8217;s tau rank correSegment-level correlation for translations into English lation coefficient.
    We calculated Kendall&#8217;s tau as: num concordant pairs - num discordant pairs T = total pairs where a concordant pair is a pair of two translations of the same segment in which the ranks calculated from the same human ranking task and from the corresponding metric scores agree; in a discordant pair, they disagree.
    In order to account fo
