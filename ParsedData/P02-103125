le fillers for each role.
  
  
    Our chunk-based system takes the last word of the chunk as its head word for the purposes of predicting roles, but does not make use of the identities of the chunk's other words or the intervening words between a chunk and the predicate, unlike Hidden Markov Model-like systems such as Bikel et al. (1997), McCallum et al.
    (2000) and Lafferty et al. (2001).
    While a more elaborate finite-state system might do better, it is possible that additional features would not be helpful given the small amount of data for each predicate.
    By using a gold-standard chunking representation, we have obtained higher performance over what could be expected from an entirely automatic system based on a flat representation of the data.
    We feel that our results show that statistical parsers, although computationally expensive, do a good job of providing relevant information for semantic interpretation.
    Not only the constituent structure but also head word information, produced a
