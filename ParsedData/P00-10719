in the question keywords.
    Crucial to the identification of the answer is the recognition of the answer type.
    Since almost always the answer type is not explicit in the question or the answer, we need to rely on lexicosemantic information provided by a parser to identify named entities (e.g. names of people or organizations, monetary units, dates and temporal/locative expressions, products and others).
    The recognition of the answer type, through the semantic tag returned by the parser, creates a candidate answer.
    The extraction of the answer and its evaluation are based on a set of heuristics.
    The Parser The parser combines information from broad coverage lexical dictionaries with semantic information that contributes to the identification of the named entities.
    Since part-ofspeech tagging is an intrinsic component of a parser, we have extended Brill's part-ofspeech tagger in two ways.
    First, we have acquired new tagging rules and secondly, we have unified the dictionaries of the ta
