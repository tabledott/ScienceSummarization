al explosion when estimating the parameters of maximum entropy models.
    We therefore require solutions to make model estimation tractable.
    This article first proposes feature forest models, which are a general solution to the problem of maximum entropy modeling of tree structures (Miyao and Tsujii 2002).
    Our algorithm avoids exponential explosion by representing probabilistic events with feature forests, which are packed representations of tree structures.
    When complete structures are represented with feature forests of a tractable size, the parameters of maximum entropy models are efficiently estimated without unpacking the feature forests.
    This is due to dynamic programming similar to the algorithm for computing inside/outside probabilities in PCFG parsing.
    The latter half of this article (Section 4) is on the application of feature forest models to disambiguation in wide-coverage HPSG parsing.
    We describe methods for representing HPSG parse trees and predicate&#8211;argument stru
