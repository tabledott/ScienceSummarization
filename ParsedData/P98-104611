tive class may have conflicting alternations (e.g., verbs of exerting force can take the conative alternation, while carry verbs cannot), this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersective class.
    As a verb of exerting force, push can appear in the conative alternation, which emphasizes its force semantic component and ability to express an &amp;quot;attempted&amp;quot; action where any result that might be associated with the verb (e.g., motion) is not necessarily achieved; as a carry verb (used with a goal or directional phrase), push cannot take the conative alternation, which would conflict with the core meaning of the carry verb class (i.e., causation of motion).
    The critical point is that, while the verb's meaning can be extended to either &amp;quot;attempted&amp;quot; action or directed motion, these two extensions cannot co-occur - they are mutually exclusive.
    However the simultaneous potential of mutually exclusive extensions is not a problem.
    It is exactly those verb
