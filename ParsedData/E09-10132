, or that irrelevant senses will influence the results.
    Furthermore, recent work in machine translation (Vickrey et al., 2005) and information retrieval (V&#180;eronis, 2004) indicates that induced senses can lead to improved performance in areas where methods based on a fixed sense inventory have previously failed (Carpuat and Wu, 2005; Voorhees, 1993).
    Sense induction is typically treated as an unsupervised clustering problem.
    The input to the clustering algorithm are instances of the ambiguous word with their accompanying contexts (represented by co-occurrence vectors) and the output is a grouping of these instances into classes corresponding to the induced senses.
    In other words, contexts that are grouped together in the same class represent a specific word sense.
    In this paper we adopt a novel Bayesian approach and formalize the induction problem in a generative model.
    For each ambiguous word we first draw a distribution over senses, and then generate context words according to th
