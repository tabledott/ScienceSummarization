			Q2 shows a maximum at k = 10, and de scends at k increases.
			This is an artifact of the MDLprinciple.
			Q2 makes the claim that a clustering so lution based on fewer clusters is preferable to one using more clusters, and that the balance between the number of clusters and the conditional entropy, H(C|K), should be measured in terms of codinglength.
			With V-measure, we present a different argu ment.
