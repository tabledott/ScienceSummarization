			This is possibly due to frequently expressed contrast sentiment types in the same sentence ? a fascinating phenomenareflecting the great complexity of the human emo tional state (and expression).
			5.3.2 Feature overlapIn our framework we have created a set of fea ture vectors for each of the Twitter sentiment tags.
			Comparison of shared features in feature vector sets allows us to estimate dependencies betweendifferent sentiment types even when direct tag cooccurrence data is very sparse.
			A feature is considered to be shared between two different senti ment labels if for both sentiment labels there is at least a single example in the training set whichhas a positive value of this feature.
			In order to automatically analyze such dependencies we calcu late the percentage of sharedWord/n-gram/Pattern features between different sentiment labels.
			Table 6 shows the observed feature overlap values for selected sentiment tags.
			We observe the trend of results obtained by comparison of shared feature
