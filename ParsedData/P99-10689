each other in order to obtain the best alignments.3 It then computes the correlation between the lengths of these non-markup text chunks.
    As is well known, there is a reliably linear relationship in the lengths of text translations &#8212; small pieces of source text translate to small pieces of target text, medium to medium, and large to large.
    Therefore we can apply a standard statistical hypothesis test, and if p &lt; .05 we can conclude that the lengths are reliably correlated and accept the page pair as likely to be translations of each other.
    Otherwise, this candidate page pair is filtered out.4 2An anonymous reviewer observes that diff has no preference for aligning chunks of similar lengths, which in some cases might lead to a poor alignment when a good one exists.
    This could result in a failure to identify true translations and is worth investigating further.
    3Chunk tokens with exactly equal lengths are excluded; see (Resnik, 1998) for reasons and other details of the algorithm.
