taphor systems use small, hand-coded semantic knowledge bases and work on a few examples.
    Although CorMet&#8217;s only knowledge base is WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) it can find the mappings constituting many conventional metaphors and in some cases recognize sentences instantiating those mappings.
    CorMet is tested on its ability to find a subset of the Master Metaphor List (Lakoff, Espenson, and Schwartz 1991).
  
  
    Lakoff (1993) argues that rather than being a rare form of creative language, some metaphors are ubiquitous, highly structured, and relevant to cognition.
    To date, there has been no robust, broadly applicable computational metaphor interpretation system, a gap this article is intended to take a first step toward filling.
    Most computational models of metaphor depend on hand-coded knowledge bases and work on a few examples.
    CorMet is designed to work on a larger class of metaphors by extracting knowledge from large corpora without drawing on any handcoded knowledge sources besid
