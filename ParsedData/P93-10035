a single bigger &amp;quot;compound sentence&amp;quot; in which noun phrases have a higher number of possible correspondences.
  
  
    Some terminology is necessary to describe the algorithm concisely.
    Let there be L total alignments in the corpus; then Ei is the English sentence for alignment i.
    Let the function 0(E2) be the number of noun phrases identified in the sentence.
    If there are k of them, k = cb(Ei), and they can be referenced by j = 1...k. Considering the j'th noun phrase in sentence Ei, the function p(Ei, j) produces an identifier for the phrase, which is the position of the phrase in the English index.
    If this phrase is at position s, then p(Ei, j) = s. In turn, the French sentence Fi will contain 0(Fi) noun phrases and given the p'th one, its position in the French index will be given by p(Fi,p).
    It will also be assumed that there are a total of VE and VE phrases in the English and French indexes respectively.
    Finally, the indicator function /0 has the value unity if it
