tries).
    If, on the other hand, the PP does modify the NP, then the parser must wait (sh6) until the PP is completed so it can build a higher NP using rule 5.
    It has been thought that, for LR parsing, multiple entries are fatal because once a parsing table has multiple entries, deterministic parsing is no longer possible and some kind of non-determinism is necessary.
    We handle multiple entries with a special technique, named a graphstructured stack.
    In order to introduce the concept, we first give a simpler form of non-determinism, and make refinements on it.
    Subsection 2.1 describes a simple and straightforward non-deterministic technique, that is, pseudo-parallelism (breadth-first search), in which the system maintains a number of stacks simultaneously, called the Stack List.
    A disadvantage of the stack list is then described.
    The next subsection describes the idea of stack combination, which was introduced in the author's earlier research (Tomita 1984), to make the algorithm much
