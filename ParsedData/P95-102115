 phenomena that, it has been argued, lie beyond Context-Free Grammars (CFG) (Shieber, 1985).
    TAG, however, has two limitations which provide the motivation for this work.
    The first problem (discussed in Section 1.1) is that the TAG operations of substitution and adjunction do not map cleanly onto the relations of complementation and modification.
    A second problem (discussed in Section 1.2) has to do with the inability of TAG to provide analyses for certain syntactic phenomena.
    In developing DTG we have tried to overcome these problems while remaining faithful to what we see as the key advantages of TAG (in particular, its enlarged domain of locality).
    In Section 1.3 we introduce some of the key features of DTG and explain how they are intended to address the problems that we have identified with TAG.
    In LTAG, the operations of substitution and adjunction relate two lexical items.
    It is therefore natural to interpret these operations as establishing a direct linguistic relation betw
