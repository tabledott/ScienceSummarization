very of the nonprojective links at parse time.
  The use of trace labels in the pseudo-projective transfor- mation leads to a proliferation of edge label types: from 69 to 234 in the training set, many of which occur only once.
  Since the running time of our parser depends on the number of labels, we used only the 20 most frequent trace labels.
  3 Semantic Submodel Our semantic model consists of three parts: ?
  A SRL classifier pipeline that generates a list of candidate predicate?argument structures.
  A constraint system that filters the candidate list to enforce linguistic restrictions on the global configuration of arguments.
  A global classifier that rescores the predicate?
  argument structures in the filtered candidate list.
  Rather than training the models on gold- standard syntactic input, we created an automati- cally parsed training set by 5-fold cross-validation.
  Training on automatic syntax makes the semantic classifiers more resilient to parsing errors, in par- ticular adjunct labeling er
