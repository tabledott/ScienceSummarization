 also to generalize this mapping function via a generative probabilistic model.
    The following section describes the creation of this model, as well as how the context-sensitive probability of each morphological transformation can be used as the fourth alignment similarity measure.
    At each iteration of the algorithm, this probabilistic mapping function is trained on the table output of the previous iteration, equivalent to the information in Table 1 (e.g.
    &lt;root,inflection&gt; pairs with optional part-of-speech tags, confidence scores and stemchange+suffix analysis) .6 From this output, we cluster the observed stem changes by the variable-length root context in which they were applied, as illustrated in Table 7.
    First note that because the triple of &lt;root&gt; + &lt;stemchange&gt; + &lt;suffix&gt; uniquely determines a resulting inflection, one can effectively compute P(inflection I root, suffix, POS) by P(stemchange I root, suffix, POS), i.e. for any root=-ya, suffix=+o- and inflection=-0a
