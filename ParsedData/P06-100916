 feature to represent whether there is a strong alignment candidate.
    The sum of these scores is also used as a feature.
    Each source word and POS tag pair are used as indicator features which allow the model to learn particular words of tags which tend to commonly (or rarely) align.
    In order to produce many-to-many alignments we combine the outputs of two models, one for each translation direction.
    We use the refined method from Och and Ney (2003) which starts from the intersection of the two models&#8217; predictions and &#8216;grows&#8217; the predicted alignments to neighbouring alignments which only appear in the output of one of the models.
  
  
    We have applied our model to two publicly available word aligned corpora.
    The first is the English-French Hansards corpus, which consists of 1.1 million aligned sentences and 484 wordaligned sentences.
    This data set was used for the 2003 NAACL shared task (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003), where the word-aligned sentences were split into a
