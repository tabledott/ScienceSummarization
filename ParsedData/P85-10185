quire that a context-free subgrammar be implicit in every grammar, the subgrammar can be used for parsing and the rest of the grammar used as a filter during or after parsing.
    This solution has been recommended for functional unification grammars (FUG) by Martin Kay 161; its legacy can be seen in the context-free skeleton of LFG, and the Hewlett-Packard GPSC; system 131, and in the cat feature requirement in PATR-Il that is described below.
    However, several problems inhere in this solution of mandating a context-free backbone.
    First, the move from context-free to complex-feature-based formalisms was motivated by the desire to structure the notion of nonterminal.
    Many analyses take advantage of this by eliminating mention of major category information from particular rules' or by structuring the major category itself (say into binary N and V features plus a bar-level feature as in X-based theories).
    Forcing the primacy and atomicity of major category defeats part of the purpose of structure
