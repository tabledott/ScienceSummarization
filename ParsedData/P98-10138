    3), Annotators (3.1) and Rearguard (4.1).
    These are purely functional designations: the same person may play different roles at different times.9 pares the initial descriptions of frames, including lists of frames and frame elements, and adds these to the Frame Database (5.1) using the Frame Description tool (1.2).
