holds the floor for a longer period of time than usual to the right of the break, then we have a topic break.
    In general, we found that the derived rules show that lexical cohesion plays a stronger role than most other features in determining topic breaks.
    Nonetheless, the quantitative results summarized in table 6, which correspond to the average performance on the held-out sets, show that the integration of conversational features with the text-based segmenter outperforms either alone.
  
  
    We presented a domain-independent segmentation algorithm for multi-party conversation that integrates features based on content with features based on form.
    The learned combination of features results in a significant increase in accuracy over previous approaches to segmentation when applied to meetings.
    Features based on form that are likely to indicate topic shifts are automatically extracted from speech.
    Content based features are computed by a segmentation algorithm that utilizes a metric of
