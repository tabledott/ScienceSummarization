s therefore that the major obstacle to effective WSD is the fine granularity of the WordNet sense inventory, rather than the performance of the best disambiguation systems.
    Interestingly, Ng et al. (1999) show that, when a coarse-grained sense inventory is adopted, the increase in interannotator agreement is much higher than the reduction of the polysemy degree.
    Following these observations, the main question that we tackle in this paper is: can we produce and evaluate coarse-grained sense distinctions and show that they help boost disambiguation on standard test sets?
    We believe that this is a crucial research topic in the field of WSD, that could potentially benefit several application areas.
    The contribution of this paper is two-fold.
    First, we provide a wide-coverage method for clustering WordNet senses via a mapping to a coarse-grained sense inventory, namely the Oxford Dictionary of English (Soanes and Stevenson, 2003) (Section 2).
    We show that this method is well-founded and acc
