inal EP corpus, respectively.
    In this way, we created two synthetic versions of the EP corpus, named S&#175;E-EP and &#175;SEEP, respectively.
    All presented translation systems were optimized on the dev2006 set with respect to the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), and tested on test2008.
    (Notice that one reference translation is available for both sets.)
    Table 1 reports statistics of original and synthetic parallel corpora, as well of the employed development and evaluation data sets.
    All the texts were just tokenized and mixed case was kept.
    Hence, all systems were developed to produce case-sensitive translations.
    Three Spanish-to-English baseline systems were trained by exploiting different parallel or monolingual corpora summarized in the first three lines in Table 2.
    For each system, the table reports the perplexity and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) percentage of their LM, and its translation performance achieved on the test set in terms of BLEU score, NIST score, WER (word err
