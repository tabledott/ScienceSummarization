  The experimental results in the precision column of Table 3 quantify the validity of this claim.
  Accu- racy varies from 90% to 99% for different types of collocation and part of speech, with a mean of 95%.
  The significance of these differences will be discussed in Section 6.2.
  These precision values have several interpretations.
  First, they reflect the underlying probability distributions of sense 268 Collocation Part Ent Prec Rec No No Type of Sp.
