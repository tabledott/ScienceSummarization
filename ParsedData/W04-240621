lusters created by an algorithm, we detect the significant clusters by ignoring (throwing out) clusters that contain less than 2% of the total instances.
    The instances in the discarded clusters are counted as unclustered instances and are subtracted from the total number of instances.
    Our basic strategy for evaluation is to assign available sense tags to the discovered clusters such that the assignment leads to a maximally accurate mapping of senses to clusters.
    The problem of assigning senses to clusters becomes one of reordering the columns of a confusion matrix that shows how senses and clusters align such that the diagonal sum is maximized.
    This corresponds to several well known problems, among them the Assignment Problem in Operations Research, or determining the maximal matching of a bipartite graph in Graph Theory.
    During evaluation we assign one sense to at most one cluster, and vice versa.
    When the number of discovered clusters is the same as the number of senses, then there i
