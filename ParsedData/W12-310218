statistically significantly outperformed by any other system.
    In the following years (Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010; Callison-Burch et al., 2011), we abandoned the idea of using fluency and adequacy judgments, since they showed to be less reliable than simple ranking of system translations.
    We also started to interpret the 5-system comparison as a set of pairwise comparisons.
    Systems were then ranked by the ratio of how often they were ranked better or equal to any of the other systems.
    Given a set J of sentence-level judgments (s1, s2, c) where s1 E S and s2 E S are two systhen we can count the total number of wins and ties of a system s as and rank systems by the ratio This ratio was used for the official rankings over the last five years.
    Bojar et al. (2011) present a persuasive argument that our ranking scheme is biased towards systems that are similar to many other systems.
    Given that most of the
