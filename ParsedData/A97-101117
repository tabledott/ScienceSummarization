    The speed roughly corresponds to 200 words in second.
    The time does not include morphological analysis and disambiguation6. broadcast literature newspaper One obvious point of reference is the ENGCG syntax, which shares a level of similar representation with an almost identical tagset to the new system.
    In addition, both systems use the front parts of the ENGCG system for processing the input.
    These include the tokeniser, lexical analyser and morphological disambiguator.
    Figure 6 shows the results of the comparison of the ENGCG syntax and the morphosyntactic level of the dependency grammar.
    Because both systems leave some amount of the ambiguity pending, two figures are given: the success rate, which is the percentage of correct morphosyntactic labels present in the output, and the ambiguity rate, which is the percentage of words containing more than one label.
    The ENGCG results compare to those reported elsewhere (Jirvinen, 1994; Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1994).
