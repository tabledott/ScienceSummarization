    CCG lexical Clark and Curran Wide-Coverage Efficient Statistical Parsing entries consist of a syntactic category, which defines valency and directionality, and a semantic interpretation.
    In this article we are concerned with the syntactic component; see Steedman (2000) for how a semantic interpretation can be composed during a syntactic derivation, and also Bos et al. (2004) for how semantic interpretations can be built for newspaper text using the wide-coverage parser described in this article.
    Categories can be either basic or complex.
    Examples of basic categories are S (sentence), N (noun), NP (noun phrase), and PP (prepositional phrase).
    Complex categories are built recursively from basic categories, and indicate the type and directionality of arguments (using slashes), and the type of the result.
    For example, the following category for the transitive verb bought specifies its first argument as a noun phrase to its right, its second argument as a noun phrase to its left, an
