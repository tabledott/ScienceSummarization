. provide an effective method for aggregating the feature values into a similarity measure using machine learning, and present results 203 on a manually annotated corpus of 10,345 pairs of compared paragraphs.
    Our new features, and especially the composite ones, are shown to outperform traditional techniques such as TF*IDF [Buckley 1985; Salton 1989] for determining similarity over small text units.
    2 Definition of Similarity Similarity is a complex concept which has been widely discussed in the linguistic, philosophical, and information theory communities.
    For example, Frawley [1992] discusses all semantic typing in terms of two mechanisms: the detection of similarity and difference.
    Jackendoff [1983] argues that standard semantic relations such as synonymy, paraphrase, redundancy, and entailment all result from judgments of likeness whereas antonymy, contradiction, and inconsistency derive from judgments of difference.
    Losee [1998] reviews notions of similarity and their impact on inform
