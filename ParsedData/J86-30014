mputational theory of discourse structure that simplifies and expands upon previous work.
    By specifying the basic units a discourse comprises and the ways in which they can relate, a proper account of discourse structure provides the basis for an account of discourse meaning.
    An account of discourse structure also plays a central role in language processing because it stipulates constraints on those portions of a discourse to which any given utterance in the discourse must be related.
    An account of discourse structure is closely related to two questions: What individuates a discourse?
    What makes it coherent?
    That is, faced with a sequence of utterances, how does one know whether they constitute a single discourse, several (perhaps interleaved) discourses, or none?
    As we develop it, the theory of discourse structure will be seen to be intimately connected with two nonlinguistic notions: intention and attention.
    Attention is an essential factor in explicating the processing of uttera
