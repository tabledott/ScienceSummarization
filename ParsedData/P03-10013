are conducted using a set of &#8220;Who is ...&#8221; questions collected over the period of a few months from the commercial question-based search engine www.askJeeves.com.
    We extract approximately 2,000,000 concept-instance relations from newspaper text using syntactic patterns and machine-learned filters (e.g., &#8220;president Bill Clinton&#8221; and &#8220;Bill Clinton, president of the USA,&#8221;).
    We then compare answers based on these relations to answers given by TextMap (Hermjakob et al., 2002), a state of the art web-based question answering system.
    Finally, we discuss the results of this evaluation and the implications and limitations of our strategy.
