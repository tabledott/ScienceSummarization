ds to opinion-bearing words and mapping semantic roles to holders and topics, and then use them for system training.
    We demonstrate that investigating semantic relations between an opinion and its holder and topic is crucial in opinion holder and topic identification.
    This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces related work both in sentiment analysis and semantic role labeling.
    Section 3 describes our approach for identifying opinions and labeling holders and topics by utilizing FrameNet1 data for our task.
    Section 4 reports our experiments and results with discussions and finally Section 5 concludes.
  
  
    This section reviews previous works in both sentiment detection and semantic role labeling.
