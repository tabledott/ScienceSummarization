p;quot;, &amp;quot;dispute&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;discussion&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tiff&amp;quot;.
    The roles defined for this frame, and shared by all its lexical entries, include PRoTAGoNiST1 and PRoTAGoNiST2 or simply PRoTAGoNiSTS for the participants in the conversation, as well as MEDiUM, and Topic.
    Example sentences are shown in Table 1.
    Defining semantic roles at the frame level avoids some of the difficulties of attempting to find a small set of universal, abstract thematic roles, or case roles such as AGENT, PATiENT, etc (as in, among many others, (Fillmore, 1968) (Jackendoff, 1972)).
    Abstract thematic roles can be thought of as being frame elements defined in abstract frames such as &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;motion&amp;quot; which are at the top of in inheritance hierarchy of semantic frames (Fillmore and Baker, 2000).
    The preliminary version of the FrameNet corpus used for our experiments contained 67 frames from 12 general semantic domains chosen for annotation.
