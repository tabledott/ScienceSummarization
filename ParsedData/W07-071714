xception of the Newswire component, which was amalgamated from several smaller corpora.
    The target genre for cross-domain adaptation was newswire, for which high-quality training material is available.
    The cross-domain development set NIST04nw is the newswire subset of the NIST 2004 evaluation set, and the dynamic adaptation development set NIST04-mix is a balanced mixed-genre subset of NIST 2004.
    The NIST 2005 evaluation set was used for testing cross-domain adaptation, and the NIST 2006 evaluation set (both the &#8220;GALE&#8221; and &#8220;NIST&#8221; parts) was used to test dynamic adaptation.
    Because different development corpora are used for cross-domain and dynamic adaptation, we trained one static baseline model for each of these adaptation settings, on the corresponding development set.
    All results given in this section are BLEU scores. newswire, sp = speeches, ed = editorial, ng = newsgroup, bn = broadcast news, and bc = broadcast conversation.
