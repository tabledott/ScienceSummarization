 deduction procedure.
    Hayes (1979) has argued that frame representations (Minsky, 1975; Bobrow and Winograd, 1977) should be viewed as sets of predicate calculus axioms together with a control component for drawing certain kinds of inferences quickly.
    In quite a different vein, Moore (1980) uses a possible worlds notation to model knowledge and action in part to avoid inefficiencies in theoremproving.
    By contrast, I would argue against building efficiencies into the notation.
    From a psychological point of view, this allows us to abstract away from the details of implementation on a particular computational device, increasing the generality of the theory.
    From a technological point of view, it reflects a belief that we must first determine empirically the most common classes of inferences required for discourse processing and only then seek algorithms for optimizing them.
    In this paper I propose a flat logical notation with an ontologically promiscuous semantics.
