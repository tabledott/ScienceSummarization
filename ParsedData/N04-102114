e is one of the best performing features.
    It seems to &#8217;fix&#8217; the tendency of our baseline system to delete content words and it improves word selection coherence by the triggering effect.
    It is also possible that the triggering effect might work on selecting a proper verb-noun combination, or a verb-preposition combination.
    As shown in Figure 1 the alignment templates (ATs) used in the baseline system can appear in various configurations which we will call left/right-monotone and left/right-continuous.
    We built 2 out of these 4 models to distinguish two types of lexicalized re-ordering of these ATs: The left-monotone model computes the total probability of all ATs being left monotone: where the lower left corner of the AT touches the upper right corner of the previous AT.
    Note that the first word in the current AT may or may not immediately follow the last word in the previous AT.
    The total probability is the product over all alignment templates i, either P(ATi is left-monot
