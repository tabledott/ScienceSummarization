pendency relations, whereas the LFG scheme abstracts away from serialization and phrase-structure.
    Facts like this can make a correct mapping of LFG f-structures to DR relations problematic.
    Indeed, we believe that we still underestimate by a few points because of DR mapping difficulties.
    4 In our evaluation, we report F-scores for both types of annotation, LFG and DR, and for three types of parse selection, (i) lower bound: random choice of a parse from the set of analyses (averaged over 10 runs), (ii) upper bound: selection of the parse with the best F-score according to the annotation scheme used, and (iii) stochastic: the parse selected by the stochastic disambiguator.
    The error reduction row lists the reduction in error rate relative to the upper and lower bounds obtained by the stochastic disambiguation model.
    F-score is defined as 2 &#215; precision &#215; recall/(precision + recall).
    The effect of the quality of the parses on disambiguation performance can be illustrated by bre
