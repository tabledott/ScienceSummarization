learn regular orthographic correspondences between source and target words, which is something edit distance cannot capture (see table 5).
    Indeed, running our MCCA model with only orthographic features on EN-ESW, labeled ORTHO in table 1, yielded 80.1 p0.33, a 31% error-reduction over EDITDIST in p0.33.
    While orthographic features are clearly effective for historically related language pairs, they are more limited for other language pairs, where we need to appeal to other clues.
    One non-orthographic clue that word types s and t form a translation pair is that there is a strong correlation between the source words used with s and the target words used with t. To capture this information, we define context features for each word type w, consisting of counts of nouns which occur within a window of size 4 around w. Consider the translation pair (time, tiempo) illustrated in figure 2.
    As we become more confident about other translation pairs which have active period and periodico context features,
