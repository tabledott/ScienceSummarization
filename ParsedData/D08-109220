 evaluation was done using the full training setup.
    Here, we report F1 scores on two sets of data.
    First, as before, we only include the sentence pairs from our bilingual corpus to fully demonstrate the gains made by joint parsing.
    We also report scores on the full test set to allow easier comparison with past work on Chinese parsing.
    For the latter evaluation, sentences that were not in the bilingual corpus were simply parsed with the baseline parsers.
    The results are in Table 6.
    Joint parsing improves F1 by 2.5 points on out-of-domain English sentences and by 1.8 points on in-domain Chinese sentences; this represents the best published Chinese treebank parsing performance, even after sentences that lack a translation are taken into account.
  
  
    To test the impact of joint parsing on syntactic MT systems, we compared the results of training an MT system with two different sets of trees: those produced by the baseline parsers, and those produced by our joint parser.
    For this
