h 3.3 describe each figure in detail, and Section 3.4 presents the results of an experiment comparing these three figures.
    Sections 4 and 5 have a similar structure to Section 3, with Section 4 evaluating two figures of merit using statistics on the left-side context of the constituent, and Section 5 evaluating three additional figures of merit using statistics on the context on both sides of the constituent.
    Section 6 contains a table summarizing the results from Sections 3, 4, and 5.
    In Section 7, we use another grammar in the experiment, to verify that our results are not an artifact of the grammar used for parsing.
    Section 8 describes previous work in this area, and Section 9 presents our conclusions and recommendations.
    There are also three appendices to this paper.
    Appendix A gives our method for computing inside probability estimates while maintaining parser speed.
    Appendix B explains how we obtained our boundary statistics used in Section 5.
    Appendix C presents data com
