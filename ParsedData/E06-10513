sults when used on domain specific texts (as is the case of the biomedical literature).
    For example, most of the participants at the Learning Language in Logic (LLL) challenge on Genic Interaction Extraction (see Section 4.2) were unable to successfully exploit linguistic information provided by parsers.
    It is still an open issue whether the use of domainspecific treebanks (such as the Genia treebank1) can be successfully exploited to overcome this problem.
    Therefore it is essential to better investigate the potential of approaches based exclusively on simple linguistic features.
    In our approach we use a combination of kernel functions to represent two distinct information sources: the global context where entities appear and their local contexts.
    The whole sentence where the entities appear (global context) is used to discover the presence of a relation between two entities, similarly to what was done by Bunescu and Mooney (2005b).
    Windows of limited size around the entities (local co
