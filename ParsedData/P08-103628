co-occurrences beyond the document level, both of which are central to our model.
    Parallel to this study Branavan et al. (2008) also showed that joint models of text and user annotations benefit extractive summarization.
    In particular, they used signals from pros-cons lists whereas our models use aspect rating signals.
  
  
    In this paper we presented a joint model of text and aspect ratings for extracting text to be displayed in sentiment summaries.
    The model uses aspect ratings to discover the corresponding topics and can thus extract fragments of text discussing these aspects without the need of annotated data.
    We demonstrated that the model indeed discovers corresponding coherent topics and achieves accuracy in sentence labeling comparable to a standard supervised model.
    The primary area of future work is to incorporate the model into an end-to-end sentiment summarization system in order to evaluate it at that level.
