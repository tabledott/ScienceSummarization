e still some residual sub-token annotations.
    Since subtoken annotations cannot be represented in the CoNLL format, and they were a very small quantity &#8211; much less than even half a percent &#8211; we decided to ignore them.
    For various reasons, not all the documents in OntoNotes have been annotated with all the different layers of annotation, with full coverage.6 There is a core portion, however, which is roughly 1.3M words which has been annotated with all the layers.
    This is the portion that we used for the shared task.
    The number of documents in the corpus for this task, for each of the different genres, are shown in Table 2.
    Tables 3 and 4 shows the distribution of mentions by the syntactic categories, and the counts of entities, links and mentions in the corpus respectively.
    All of this data has been Treebanked and PropBanked either as part of the OntoNotes effort or some preceding effort.
    For comparison purposes, Table 2 also lists the number of documents in the MUC-6, M
