through all rulecutoff points: all unary learning algorithms per form better than binary DIRT in all parameters.
			The inferior behavior of binary DIRT is analyzed in Section 5.2.The graphs show that symmetric unary approaches substantially increase recall, but dramati cally decrease precision already at the top 10 rules.
			As a result, F1 only decreases for these methods.
			Lin similarity (DIRT) and Weeds-Harmonic show similar behaviors.
			They consistently outperform Derived-Avg.
			One reason for this is that incorrectunary rules may be derived even from correct bi nary rules.
			For example, from ?X gain seat on Y ? elect X to Y ? the incorrect unary rule ?X gain?
			electX?
			is also generated.
			This problem is less frequent when unary rules are directly scored based on their corpus statistics.
			The directional measure of BInc yields a more accurate rule-base, as can be seen by the much slower precision reduction rate compared to theother algorithms.
			As a result, it is the only algo rithm tha
