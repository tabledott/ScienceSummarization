or the task of polarity classification is preceded by Moilanen and Pulman (2007), but our work differs in that we integrate the key idea of compositional semantics into learning-based methods, and that we perform empirical comparisons among reasonable alternative approaches.
    For comparison, we evaluated our approaches on the polarity classification task from SemEval-07 (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007).
    We achieve 88.6% accuracy with COMPOPR, 90.1% with SCNEGEX, and 87.6% with CCICOMPOMC.9 There are a number of possible reasons for our lower performance vs. Moilanen and Pulman (2007) on this data set.
    First, SemEval-07 does not include a training data set for this task, so we use 400 documents from the MPQA corpus instead.
    In addition, the SemEval-07 data is very different from the MPQA data in that (1) the polarity annotation is given only at the sentence level, (2) the sentences are shorter, with simpler structure, and not as many negators as the MPQA sentences, and (3) there are many more in
