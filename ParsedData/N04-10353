 in syntax-based statistical MT.
    We take this approach in our paper.
    Of course, the broad statistical MT program is aimed at a wider goal than the conventional rule-based program &#8211; it seeks to understand and explain human translation data, and automatically learn from it.
    For this reason, we think it is important to learn from the model/data explainability studies of Fox (2002) and to extend her results.
    In addition to being motivated by rule-based systems, we also see advantages to English syntax within the statistical framework, such as marrying syntax-based translation models with syntaxbased language models (Charniak et al., 2003) and other potential benefits described by Eisner (2003).
    Our basic idea is to create transformation rules that condition on larger fragments of tree structure.
    It is certainly possible to build such rules by hand, and we have done this to formally explain a number of humantranslation examples.
    But our main interest is in collecting a large set o
