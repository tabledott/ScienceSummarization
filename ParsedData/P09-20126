e GX defines the probability of a subtree t as the product of the PCFG rules r E t that constitute it and a geometric distribution Pr$ over the number of those rules, thus encoding a preference for smaller subtrees.3 The parameter &#945; contributes to the probability that previously unseen subtrees will be sampled.
    All DPs share parameters p$ and &#945;.
    An entire grammar is then given as g = {gX : X E N}.
    We emphasize that no head information is used by the sampler.
    Rather than explicitly consider each segmentation of the parse trees (which would define a TSG and its associated parameters), we use a collapsed Gibbs sampler to integrate over all possible grammars and sample directly from the posterior.
    This is based on the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) representation of the DP.
    The Gibbs sampler is an iterative procedure.
    At initialization, each parse tree in the corpus is annotated with a specific derivation by marking each node in the tree with a binary flag.
    This flag in
