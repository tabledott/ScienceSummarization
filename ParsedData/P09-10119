e, the complexity of the language used in the recap is far greater than what we can represent using our simple model.
    Fortunately, most of the fields are integer fields or string fields (generally names or brief descriptions), which provide important anchor points for learning the correspondences.
    Nonetheless, the same names and numbers occur in multiple records, so there is still uncertainty about which record is referenced by a given sentence.
  
  
    To learn the correspondence between a text w and a world state s, we propose a generative model p(w I s) with latent variables specifying this correspondence.
    Our model combines segmentation with alignment.
    The segmentation aspect of our model is similar to that of Grenager et al. (2005) and Eisenstein and Barzilay (2008), but in those two models, the segments are clustered into topics rather than grounded to a world state.
    The alignment aspect of our model is similar to the HMM model for word alignment (Ney and Vogel, 1996).
