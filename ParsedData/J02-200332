ation score with respect to eat.
    However, (location) is a kind of (entity) in WordNet,10 and choosing the class with the highest association score is likely to produce (entity) as the chosen class.
    This is a problem, because the association score of (entity) with respect to eat may be too high to reflect the fact that (location) is a very unlikely object of the verb.
    Note that the solution to the vertical-ambiguity problem presented in the previous sections is able to generalize appropriately in such cases.
    Continuing with the eat (location) example, our generalization procedure is unlikely to get as high as (entity) (assuming a reasonable number of examples of eat in the training data), since the probabilities corresponding to the daughters of (entity) are likely to be very different with respect to the object position of eat.
    The second alternative uses the minimum description length (MDL) principle.
    Li and Abe use MDL to select a set of classes from a hierarchy, together with their
