rove performance.
    It is possible that some sample selection of words from document candidates might be profitable (e.g., creating a sample of size proportional to the document length, as opposed to a fixed size, or sampling only from content words, or sampling only words present in the dictionary).
    Smith (2002) suggested a bootstrapping paradigm for the construction of parallel corpora.
    Beginning with a seed set of translation information (either parallel corpora or a bilingual dictionary), high-precision initial classifiers might be constructed using content and/or structural features (whichever are available).
    We might then iteratively select additional page pairs in which the current classifier has high confidence of translational equivalence, gradually increasing the pool of parallel data and at the same time expanding the bilingual lexicon.
    This approach to minimally supervised classifier construction has been widely studied (Yarowsky 1995), especially in cases in which the features o
