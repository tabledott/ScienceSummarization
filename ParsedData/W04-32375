he first word in a sentence is most likely capitalized2.
    Due to its popularity, both our work and that of (Lita et al., 2003) uses the 1-gram capitalizer as a baseline.
    The work in (Kim and Woodland, 2004) indicates that the same 1-gram algorithm is used in Microsoft Word 2000 and is consequently used as a baseline for evaluating the performance of their algorithm as well.
    We share the approach to capitalization as sequence tagging with that of (Lita et al., 2003).
    In their approach, a language model is built on pairs (word, tag) and then used to disambiguate over all possible tag assignments to a sentence using dynamic programming techniques.
    The same idea is explored in (Kim and Woodland, 2004) in the larger context of automatic punctuation generation and capitalization from speech recognition output.
    A second approach they consider for capitalization is the use a rule-based tagger as described by (Brill, 1994), which they show to outperform the case sensitive language modeling appro
