y rules applied during the derivation, and outputting the dependencies.
    This method was also applied to the trees in section 23 to provide the gold standard test set.
    Not all trees produced dependency structures, since not all categories and type-changing rules in the CCGbank are encoded in the parser.
    We obtained dependency structures for roughly 95% of the trees in the data.
    For evaluation purposes, we increased the coverage on section 23 to 990% (2 352 sentences) by identifying the cause of the parse failures and adding the additional rules and categories when creating the gold-standard; so the final test set consisted of gold-standard dependency structures from 2 352 sentences.
    The coverage was increased to ensure the test set was representative of the full section.
    We emphasise that these additional rules and categories were not made available to the parser during testing, or used for training.
    Initially the parser was run with 0 001 for the supertagger (an average of 38 categ
