 by the maximum reduction in entropy the clustering information could provide, i.e.
    H(S).
    When there is only a single class (H(S) = 0), any clustering would produce a perfectly homogeneous solution.
    Completeness.
    Symmetrically to homogeneity, the completeness, c, of a clustering solution is defined in Formula 4, where H(K|S) is the conditional entropy of the cluster distribution given the class distribution and H(K) is the clustering entropy.
    When H(K|S) is 0, the solution is perfectly complete, because all data points of a class belong to the same cluster.
    For the clustering example in Table 3, homogeneity is equal to 0.404, completeness is equal to 0.37 and V-Measure is equal to 0.386.
    In this evaluation, the clustering problem is transformed into a classification problem.
    For each cluster Ci we generate (|Ci|&#65533; instance pairs, where 2 |Ci |is the total number of instances that belong to cluster Ci.
    Similarly, for each GS class Gi we generate (|Gi|&#65533; instance
