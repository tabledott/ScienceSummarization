iscourse model easier to build and reason with.
    In what follows we make use of two functions: function applied to a tuple yields the discourse relation ; function applied to a tuple yields the structure .
    Given a set of adequate parameters , our discourse model estimates the goodness of a discourse parse tree using formula (3). ce set extracted from a DS-LST. goodness of the structure of We expect these probabilities to prefer the hierarchical structure (1, (2, 3)) over ((1,2), 3) for the discourse tree in Figure 1.
    For each tuple ,the probability estimates the goodness of the discourse relation of .
    We expect these probabilities to prefer the rhetorical relation ATTRIBUTION-NS . over CONTRAST-NN for the relation between spans 1 and in the discourse tree in Figure 1.
    The overall probability of a discourse tree is obtained multiplying the structural probabilities and the relational probabilities for all the tuples in the discourse tree.
    Our discourse model uses as the information presen
