w a definition of in this way.
    In general the lack of per-sentence scores makes it challenging to apply significance tests to Bleu scores.2 To get around this problem, we make the following approximation.
    For any test sentence , we calculate as follows.
    First, we define to be the Bleu score for the test corpus when translated by the baseline model.
    Next, we define to be the Bleu score when all sentences other than are translated by the baseline model, and where itself is translated by the reordered model.
    We then define If If If Note that strictly speaking, this definition of is not valid, as it depends on the entire set of sample points rather than alone.
    However, we believe it is a reasonable approximation to an ideal 2The lack of per-sentence scores means that it is not possible to apply standard statistical tests such as the sign test or the ttest (which would test the hypothesis , where is the expected value under ).
