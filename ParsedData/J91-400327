 expressions (for example, the f-structure in Lexical Functional Grammar [Bresnan 1982] and the Projection Principle in Government-Binding Theory [Chomsky 1981]).
    One of the most important contributions has been the view that argument structure is highly structured independent of the syntax.
    Williams's (1981) distinction between external and internal arguments and Grimshaw's proposal for a hierarchically structured representation (Grimshaw 1990) provide us with the basic syntax for one aspect of a word's meaning.
    The argument structure for a word can be seen as a minimal specification of its lexical semantics.
    By itself, it is certainly inadequate for capturing the semantic characterization of a lexical item, but it is a necessary component.
    As mentioned above, the theory of decomposition being outlined here is based on the central idea that word meaning is highly structured, and not simply a set of semantic features.
    Let us assume this is the case.
    Then the lexical items in a lang
