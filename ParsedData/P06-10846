e expert system is applied, dis24&#8211;86). ambiguating 35% of the ambiguous words with an accuracy of 99.6%.
    In order to increase the applicability of the disambiguation, approximated probabilities are used for words that were not disambiguated in the first stage.
    Finally, the expert system is used again over the new probabilities that were set in the previous stage.
    Levinger reports an accuracy of about 94% for disambiguation of 85% of the words in the text (overall 80% disambiguation).
    The system was also applied to prune out the least likely analyses in a corpus but without, necessarily, selecting a single analysis for each word.
    For this task, an accuracy of 94% was reported while reducing 92% of the ambiguous analyses.
    Carmel and Maarek (1999) use the fact that on average 45% of the Hebrew words are unambiguous, to rank analyses, based on the number of disambiguated occurrences in the text, normalized by the total number of occurrences for each word.
