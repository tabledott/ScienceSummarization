be defined more precisely in terms of words, e.g., using the Longest Common Subsequence Ratio.
    Most importantly, matching heuristics based on existing translation lexicons can be defined only at the word level.
    When neither cognates nor sentence boundaries can be found, we can still map bitexts in any pair of languages using a small hand-constructed translation lexicon.
    To complement wordbased matching predicates, I have proposed localized noise filtering.
    Localized noise filters are more accurate than global ones because they are sensitive to local variations in noise distributions.
    The combination of a strong signal and an accurate noise filter enables localized search heuristics.
    Localized search heuristics can directly exploit the geometric tendencies of TPC chains in order to search the bitext space in linear space and time.
    This level of efficiency is particularly important for large bitexts.
    SIMR also advances the state of the art of bitext mapping on several other crite
