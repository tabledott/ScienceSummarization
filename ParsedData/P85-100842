nouns fell out of our underlying ontological stricture at no extra cost, but if the extra cost is great complication in statements of discourse operations, it would be quite unpleasant.
    In constructing a theory of discourse interpretation, it doesn't make sense for us to tie our hands by requiring syntactic explanations as well.
    The problem of discourse is at least an order of magnitude harder than the problem of syntax, and syntax shouldn't be in the driver's seat.
    Efficient deduction: There is a long tradition in artificial intelligence of building control information into the notation, and indeed much work in knowledge representation is driven by this consideration.
    Semantic networks and other notational systems built around hierarchies (Quillian, 1968; Simmons, 1973; Hendrix, 1975) implicitly assign a low cost to certain types of syllogistic reasoning.
    The KL-ONE representation language (Schmolze and Brachman, 1982) has a variety of notational devices, each with an associated efficient
