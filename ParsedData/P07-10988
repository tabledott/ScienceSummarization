ering subparts, the resulting feature space is usually very large.
    A tree kernel (TK) function which computes the number of common subtrees between two syntactic parse trees has been given in (Collins and Duffy, 2002).
    Unfortunately, such subtrees are subject to the constraint that their nodes are taken with all or none of the children they have in the original tree.
    This makes the TK function not well suited for the PAS trees defined above.
    For instance, although the two PASs of Figure 1 share most of the subtrees rooted in the PAS node, Collins and Duffy&#8217;s kernel would compute no match.
    In the next section we describe a new kernel derived from the above tree kernel, able to evaluate the meaningful substructures for PAS trees.
    Moreover, as a single PAS may not be sufficient for text representation, we propose a new kernel that combines the contributions of different PASs.
    Given two trees T1 and T2, let {f1, f2, ..} = F be the set of substructures (fragments) and Ii(n) be equ
