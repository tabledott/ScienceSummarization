s serve as input to a machine learning algorithm, under a supervised training methodology, which produces an automatic classification system for our three verb classes.
    Since we rely on patterns of behavior across multiple occurrences of a verb, we begin with the problem of assigning a single class to the entire set of usages of a verb within the corpus.
    For example, we measure properties across all occurrences of a word, such as raced, in order to assign a single classification to the lexical entry for the verb race.
    This contrasts with work classifying individual occurrences of a verb in each local context, which have typically relied on training that includes instances of the verbs to be classified&#8212;essentially developing a bias that is used in conjunction with the local context to determine the best classification for new instances of previously seen verbs.
    By contrast, our method assigns a classification to verbs that have not previously been seen in the training data.
    Thus, whil
