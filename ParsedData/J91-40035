tail abstracting the notion of lexical meaning away from other semantic influences.
    For instance, this might suggest that discourse and pragmatic factors should be handled differently or separately from the semantic contributions of lexical items in composition.'
    Although this is not a necessary assumption and may in fact be wrong, it may help narrow our focus on what is important for lexical semantic descriptions.
    Secondly, lexical semantics must look for representations that are richer than thematic role descriptions (Gruber 1965; Fillmore 1968).
    As argued in Levin and Rappaport (1986), named roles are useful at best for establishing fairly general mapping strategies to the syntactic structures in language.
    The distinctions possible with thetaroles are much too coarse-grained to provide a useful semantic interpretation of a sentence.
    What is needed, I will argue, is a principled method of lexical decomposition.
    This presupposes, if it is to work at all, (1) a rich, recursive theo
