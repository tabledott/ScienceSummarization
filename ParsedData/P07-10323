another.
    Second, we develop a method for measuring how effective the conversion process is, which also provides an upper bound for the performance of the parser, given the conversion process being used; this method can be adapted by other researchers to strengthen their own parser comparisons.
    And third, we provide the first evaluation of a widecoverage CCG parser outside of CCGbank, obtaining impressive results on DepBank and outperforming the RASP parser (Briscoe et al., 2006) by over 5% overall and on the majority of dependency types.
  
  
    The most common form of parser evaluation is to apply the Parseval metrics to phrase-structure parsers based on the Penn Treebank, and the highest reported scores are now over 90% (Bod, 2003; Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
    However, it is unclear whether these high scores accurately reflect the performance of parsers in applications.
    It has been argued that the Parseval metrics are too forgiving and that phrase structure is not the ideal representation
