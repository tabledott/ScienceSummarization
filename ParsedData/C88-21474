on we have placed on the set of auxiliary trees that can be adjoined at a node is that the label of the node must be the same as the label of tile root (and the foot) node of the auxiliary tree.
  Fmther estriction on this set of auxiliary trees is done by enumerating with each node the subset of anxiliary trees which can be adjoined at that node.
  This specification of a set of auxiliary trees, which can be adjoined at a node, is called the Selective Adjoining (SA) constraints.
  In tim case where we specify the empty set, we say that the node has a Nail Adjoining (NA)  constraint:~.
  It is possible to insist that adjunction is mandatory at a node.
  In such a case, wc say that the node has an Obligatory Adjoining (OA) constraint.
  A more detailed description of TAGs and their linguistic relevance may be found in [Kroeh et al.
