ip between discourse coherence, inference load, and choice of referring expression.
    Underlying these claims is the most fundamental claim of centering theory, that to the extent a discourse adheres to centering constraints, its coherence will increase and the inference load placed upon the hearer will decrease.
    We briefly list several major claims in this section, and elaborate on the evidence or motivation for each in subsequent sections.
    Cb (Un+1); because Cf(Un) is only partially ordered, additional factors may constrain the choice.'
    Before we can examine the linguistic features that contribute to an entity's being the backward-looking center of an utterance, it is necessary to provide support for the claim that there is only a single backward-looking center.
    In the definitions in Section 3, there is a basic asymmetry between the Cf, which is a set, and the Cb, which is a singleton.
    Sequences like those in (6) seem to suggest that there might be multiple Cb's, analogous to the parti
