algorithm scales by providing information on how training time grows with training-set size.
    Finally, all results are averaged over ten random selections of training and test sets.
    The performance of a system can vary a fair bit from trial to trial, and a difference in accuracy on a single training set may not indicate an overall performance advantage.
    Unfortunately, most results reported in empirical natural-language research present only a single or very small number of trials.
    Running multiple trials also allows for statistical testing of the significance of any resulting differences in average performance.
    We employ a simple two-tailed, paired t-test to compare the performance of two systems for a given trainingset size, requiring significance at the 0.05 level.
    Even more sophisticated statistical analysis of the results is perhaps warranted.
    The resulting learning curves are shown in Figure 1 and results on training and testing time are shown in Figures 2 and 3.
