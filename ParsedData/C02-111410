nk to or ange, banana or any of their neighbours except for apple.
			One way to summarise the effect of this decision is that the algorithm adds words to clusters depending on type frequency rather than token frequency.
			This avoids spurious links due to (for example) particular idioms rather than geniune semantic similarity.
	
	
			In this section we give examples of lexical cat egories extracted by our method and evaluatethem against the corresponding classes in Word Net.
			5.1 Methodology.
			Our methodology is as follows.
			Consider an intuitive category of objects such as musical instruments.
			Define the ?WordNet class?
			or ?WordNet category?
			of musical instruments tobe the collection of synsets subsumed in Word Net by the musical instruments synset.
			Take a ?protypical example?
			of a musical instrument, such as piano.
			The algorithm defined in (1) gives a way of finding the n nodes deemed to be most closely related to the piano node.
			Thesecan then be checked to see if they are membe
