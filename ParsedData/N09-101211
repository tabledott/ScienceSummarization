    The probability of deciding whether to generate another argument is conditioned on H, d and whether this would be the first argument (this is the sense in which it models valence).
    When DMV generates an argument, the part-of-speech of that argument A is generated given H and d. 1Efficiently parsable versions of split-head bilexical CFGs for the models described in this paper can be derived using the fold-unfold grammar transform (Eisner and Blatz, 2007; Johnson, 2007). tence.
    Note that these rules are for VH, A E VT so there is an instance of the first schema rule for each part-of-speech.
    YH splits words into their left and right components.
    LH encodes the stopping decision given that we have not generated any arguments so far.
    L&#8242;H encodes the same decision after generating one or more arguments.
    L1H represents the distribution over left attachments.
    To extract dependency relations from these parse trees, we scan for attachment rules (e.g., L1H &#8212;* YA L&#82
