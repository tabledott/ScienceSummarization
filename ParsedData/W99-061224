nt is found, then a simple linear combination of all four is considered for the decision.
    This approach yields 6% higher F-measure than the simple interpolation of classifiers for the default parameters.
    Stage 4: The newly classified tokens and contexts are saved for future use as potential seed data in subsequent named-entity classification on new texts.
  
  
    The basic measures for evaluation of this work are precision and recall.
    Precision (P) represents the percentage of the entities that the system recognized which are actually correct.
    Recall (R) represents the percentage of the correct named entities in the text that the system identified.
    Both measures are incorporated in the F-measure, F = 2PRAP + R).
    It would be inappropriate to compare the results of a language independent system with the ones designed for only one language.
    As Day and Palmer (1997) observed, &amp;quot;the fact that existing systems perform extremely well on mixed-case English newswire corpora is cer
