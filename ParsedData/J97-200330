ollowing definition for characterizing the transducers that admit determinization.
    Two states q and q' of a string-to-weight transducer T = (Q, I, F, E, 6, a, A, p), not necessarily subsequential, are said to be twins if: In other words, q and q' are twins if, when they can be reached from the initial state by the same string u, the minimum outputs of loops at q and q' labeled with any string v are identical.
    We say that T has the twins property when any two states q and q' of T are twins.
    Notice that according to the definition, two states that do not have cycles with the same string v are twins.
    In particular, two states that do not belong to any cycle are necessarily twins.
    Thus, an acyclic transducer has the twins property In the following section, we consider subsequential power series in the tropical semiring, that is, functions that can be realized by subsequential string-to-weight transducers.
    Many rational power series defined on the tropical semiring considered in practice ar
