xt segments, the absolute value of sim(x, y) is unreliable.
    An additional occurrence of a common word (reflected in the numerator) causes a disproportionate increase in sim(x, y) unless the denominator (related to segment length) is large.
    Thus, in the context of text segmentation where a segment has typically &lt; 100 informative tokens, one can only use the metric to estimate the order of similarity between sentences, e.g. a is more similar to b than c. Furthermore, language usage varies throughout a document.
    For instance, the introduction section of a document is less cohesive than a section which is about a particular topic.
    Consequently, it is inappropriate to directly compare the similarity values from different regions of the similarity matrix.
    In non-parametric statistical analysis, one compares the rank of data sets when the qualitative behaviour is similar but the absolute quantities are unreliable.
    We present a ranking scheme which is an adaptation of that described in (O'N
