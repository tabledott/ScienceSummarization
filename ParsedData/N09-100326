sed methods.
    The most similar approach to our distributional technique is Finkelstein et al. (2002), who combined distributional similarities from Web documents with a similarity from WordNet.
    Their results are probably worse due to the smaller data size (they used 270,000 documents) and the differences in the calculation of the similarities.
    The only method which outperforms our non-supervised methods is that of (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) when based on Wikipedia, probably because of the dense, manually distilled knowledge contained in Wikipedia.
    All in all, our supervised combination gets the best published results on this dataset.
  
  
    This paper has presented two state-of-the-art distributional and WordNet-based similarity measures, with a study of several parameters, including performance on similarity and relatedness data.
    We show that the use of disambiguated glosses allows for the best published results for WordNet-based systems on the WordSim353 dataset, mainly due to
