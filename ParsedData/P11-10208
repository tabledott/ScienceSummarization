al stimulus &#8211; and the dramatically larger scale of the data collected.
  
  
    Since our goal was to collect large numbers of paraphrases quickly and inexpensively using a crowd, our framework was designed to make the tasks short, simple, easy, accessible and somewhat fun.
    For each task, we asked the annotators to watch a very short video clip (usually less than 10 seconds long) and describe in one sentence the main action or event that occurred in the video clip We deployed the task on Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk, with video segments selected from YouTube.
    A screenshot of our annotation task is shown in Figure 1.
    On average, annotators completed each task within 80 seconds, including the time required to watch the video.
    Experienced annotators were even faster, completing the task in only 20 to 25 seconds.
    One interesting aspect of this framework is that each annotator approaches the task from a linguistically independent perspective, unbiased by the lexical or word order choic
