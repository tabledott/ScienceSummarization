  It prop- erly contains cross-speaker interruptions that in- volve topic shift, similar to the true-interruptions of Grosz and Sidner[GS86], as well as clarification subdialogues[Sid83, LA90].
  This classification suggests that the transfer of control is often a collaborative phenomenon.
  Since a noncontroller(OCP), has the option of seizing con- trol at any juncture in discourse, it would seem that controllers(ICPs), are in control because the noncontroller allows it.
  These observations address problems raised by Grosz and Sidner, namely how ICPs signal and OCPs recognize segment bound- aries.
  The claim is that shifts of control often do not occur until the controller indicates the end of a discourse segment by abdicating or producing a repetition/summary.
