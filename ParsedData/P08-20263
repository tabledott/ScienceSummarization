tility of selftraining for adaptation.
    The first is the parsing results are quite poor by modern standards.1 Steedman et al. (2003) generally found that selftraining does not work, but found that it does help if the baseline results were sufficiently bad.
    Secondly, the difference between the Brown corpus treebank and the Wall Street Journal corpus is not that great.
    One way to see this is to look at out-of-vocabulary statistics.
    The Brown corpus has an out-of-vocabulary rate of approximately 6% when given WSJ training as the lexicon.
    In contrast, the out-of-vocabulary rate of biomedical abstracts given the same lexicon is significantly higher at about 25% (Lease and Charniak, 2005).
    Thus the bridge the selftrained parser is asked to build is quite short.
    This second point is emphasized by the second paper on self-training for adaptation (McClosky et al., 2006b).
    This paper is based on the C/J parser and thus its results are much more in line with modern expectations.
