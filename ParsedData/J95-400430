ained the transformation-based tagger on the same corpus, making the same closed-vocabulary assumption.'
    When training contextual rules on 600,000 words, an accuracy of 97.2% was achieved on a separate 150,000 word test set.
    When the training set was reduced to 64,000 words, accuracy dropped to 96.7%.
    The transformation-based learner achieved better performance, despite the fact that contextual information was captured in a small number of simple nonstochastic rules, as opposed to 10,000 contextual probabilities that were learned by the stochastic tagger.
    These results are summarized in table 1.
    When training on 600,000 words, a total of 447 transformations were learned.
    However, transformations toward the end of the list contribute very little to accuracy: applying only the first 200 learned transformations to the test set achieves an accuracy of 97.0%; applying the first 100 gives an accuracy of 96.8%.
    To match the 96.7% accuracy achieved by the stochastic tagger when it was trai
