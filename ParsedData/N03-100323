ng a variety ofpossible slot values, while sentences are self-contained units.
    Figure 5 shows two example sentences, one where our MSA-based paraphrase was deemed correct by both judges, and one where both judges deemed the MSAgenerated paraphrase incorrect.
    Examination of the results indicates that the two systems make essentially orthogonal types of errors.
    The baseline system&#8217;s relatively poor performance supports our claim that whole-sentence paraphrasing is a hard task even when accurate wordlevel paraphrases are given.
  
  
    We presented an approach for generating sentence level paraphrases, a task not addressed previously.
    Our method learns structurally similar patterns of expression from data and identifies paraphrasing pairs among them using a comparable corpus.
    A flexible pattern-matching procedure allows us to paraphrase an unseen sentence by matching it to one of the induced patterns.
    Our approach generates both lexical and structural paraphrases.
