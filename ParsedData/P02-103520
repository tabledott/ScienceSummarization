aking down the F-scores according to whether the parser yields full parses, FRAGMENT, SKIMMED, or SKIMMED+FRAGMENT parses for the test sentences.
    The percentages of test examples which belong to the respective classes of quality are listed in the first row of Table 2.
    F-scores broken down according to classes of parse quality are recorded in the following rows.
    The first column shows F-scores for all parses in the test set, as in Table 1.
    The second column shows the best F-scores when restricting attention to examples which receive only full parses.
    The third column reports F-scores for examples which receive only non-full parses, i.e.
    FRAGMENT or SKIMMED parses or SKIMMED+FRAGMENT parses.
    Columns 4-6 break down non-full parses according to examples which receive only FRAGMENT, only SKIMMED, or only SKIMMED+FRAGMENT parses.
