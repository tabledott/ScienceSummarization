erent text types.
    Although the system was developed and tested on biomedical text, the same approach can also be applied to text from other domains.
    The paper is organised as follows.
    In Section 2, we summarise related work.
    In Section 3, we describe the corpus on which the system has been developed.
    In Section 4, we introduce the task to be performed by the system, which is described in Section 5.
    Results are presented and discussed in Section 6.
    Finally, Section 7 puts forward some conclusions.
