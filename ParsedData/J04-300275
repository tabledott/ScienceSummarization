exemes to the classification of instances in context (compare, e.g., &#8220;great!&#8221; and &#8220;oh great.&#8221;) In addition, it would be illuminating to apply our system to data annotated with discourse trees (Carlson, Marcu, and Okurowski 2001).
    We hypothesize that most objective sentences identified by our system are dominated in the discourse by subjective sentences and that we are moving toward identifying subjective discourse segments.
