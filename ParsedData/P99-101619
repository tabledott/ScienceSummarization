ects have the goal of building a single cluster of, e.g., vehicles, and both use seed words to initialize a cluster with nouns belonging to it.
    Hearst (1992) introduced the idea of learning hypernym-hyponym relationships from text and gives several examples of patterns that can be used to detect these relationships including those used here, along with an algorithm for identifying new patterns.
    This work shares with ours the feature that it does not need large amounts of data to learn a hypernym; unlike in much statistical work, a single occurrence is sufficient.
    The hyponym-hypernym pairs found by Hearst's algorithm include some that Hearst describes as &amp;quot;context and point-of-view dependent,&amp;quot; such as &amp;quot;Washington/nationalist&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;aircraft/target&amp;quot; .
    Our work is somewhat less sensitive to this kind of problem since only the most common hypernym of an entire cluster of nouns is reported, so much of the noise is filtered.
