ralizations and extensions of the Incremental Algorithm of Dale and Reiter (1995).
  
  
    Generation of referring expressions (GRE) is a key task of most natural language generation (NLG) systems (e.g., Reiter and Dale 2000, Section 5.4).
    Regardless of the type of knowledge base (KB) forming the input to the generator, many objects will not be designated in it via an ordinary proper name.
    A person like Mr. Jones, for example, may be designated using an artificial name like #Jones083, if the name Jones is not uniquely distinguishing.
    The same is true for a piece of furniture, a tree, or an atomic particle, for instance, for which no proper name is in common use at all, or (in most cases) if the generator tries to refer to an entire set of objects.
    In all such cases, the generator has to &#8220;invent&#8221; a description that enables the hearer to identify the intended referent.
    In the case of Mr. Jones, for example, the program could identify him by providing his full name and address;
