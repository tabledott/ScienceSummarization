  Correcting ESL Errors Using Phrasal SMT Techniques
  
    This paper presents a pilot study of the use of phrasal Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) techniques to identify and correct writing errors made by learners of English as a Second Language (ESL).
    Using examples of mass noun errors in the Learner Error Cor- (CLEC) guide creation of an engineered training set, we show that application of the SMT paradigm can capture errors not well addressed by widely-used proofing tools designed for native speakers.
    Our system was able to correct 61.81% of mistakes in a set of naturallyoccurring examples of mass noun errors found on the World Wide Web, suggesting that efforts to collect alignable corpora of preand post-editing ESL writing samples offer can enable the development of SMT-based writing assistance tools capable of repairing many of the complex syntactic and lexical problems found in the writing of ESL learners.
