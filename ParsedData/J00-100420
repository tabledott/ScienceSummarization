each derivation generates a pair of dependency trees.
    Such a pair can be represented as a synchronized hierarchical alignment of two strings.
    A hierarchical alignment consists of four functions.
    The first two functions are an alignment mapping f from source words w to target words f(w) (which may be the empty string &#8364;), and an inverse alignment mapping from target words v to source words f' (v).
    The inverse mapping is needed to handle mapping of target words to c; it coincides with f for pairs without source &#8364;.
    The other two functions are a source head-map g mapping source dependent words w to their heads g(w) in the source string, and a target head-map h mapping target dependent words v to their headwords h(v) in the target string.
    An A hierarchical alignment: alignment mappings f and f', and head-maps g and h. example hierarchical alignment is shown in Figure 6 (f and f' are shown separately for clarity).
    A hierarchical alignment is synchronized (i.e., it corresponds
