ufficiently general to cover a significant number of noun compounds, but that can be domain specific enough to be useful in analysis.
    We want to support relationships between entities that are shown to be important in cognitive linguistics, in particular we intend to support the kinds of inferences that arise from Talmy&#8217;s force dynamics (Talmy, 1985).
    It has been shown that relations of this kind can be combined in order to determine the &#8220;directionality&#8221; of a sentence (e.g., whether or not a politician is in favor of, or opposed to, a proposal) (Hearst, 1990).

    In theoretical linguistics, there are contradictory views regarding the semantic properties of noun compounds (NCs).
