    She also notices that verb selectional restrictions are an lished that semantic priming&#8212;a process in which the introduction of a certain concept will influence and facilitate the processing of subsequently introduced concepts that are semantically related&#8212;plays a role in disambiguation by humans (see, e.g., Meyer and Schvaneveldt [19711).
    This idea is realized in spreading activation models (see Collins and Loftus [1975]; Anderson [1976, 1983]), where concepts in a semantic network are activated upon use, and activation spreads to connected nodes.
    Activation is weakened as it spreads, but certain nodes may receive activation from several sources and be progressively reinforced.
    McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) added to the model by introducing the notion of inhibition among nodes, where the activation of a node might suppress, rather than activate, certain of its neighbors (see also Feldman and Ballard [1982]).
    Applied to lexical disambiguation, this approa
