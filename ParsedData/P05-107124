ens, using the Penn Treebank (PTB) tagset as well as the smaller tagset (Smp) (see Footnote 9); BL is the baseline obtained by using the POS value from the baseline tag used in Section 6 similarly.
    We obtain a score for TE1 of 97.6% on all tokens.
    Diab et al. (2004) report a score of 95.5% for all tokens on a test corpus drawn from ATB1, thus their figure is comparable to our score of 97.6%.
    On our own reduced POS tagset, evaluating on TE1, we obtain an accuracy score of 98.1% on all tokens.
    The full dataset is shown in Figure 6.
  
  
    We have shown how to use a morphological analyzer for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and morphological disambiguation in Arabic.
    We have shown that the use of a morphological analyzer is beneficial in POS tagging, and we believe our results are the best published to date for tokenization of naturally occurring input (in undiacritized orthography) and POS tagging.
    We intend to apply our approach to Arabic dialects, for which currently no annota
