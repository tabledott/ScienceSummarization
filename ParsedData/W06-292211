.g.
    Portuguese, training required over 4 days but produced a bad model which could not be used (I tried both the TinySVM (Kudo 2002) and the LIBSVM (Chang and Lin 2001) implementations).
    Given the speed of the Maximum Entropy classifier, I explored whether increasing the number of features could improve accuracy.
    I experimented adding various features controlled by the parameters above: none appeared to be effective, except the addition of the previous action.
    The classifier returns both the action and the label to be assigned.
    Some experiments were carried out splitting the task among several specialized classifiers.
    I experimented with: 2. two classifiers: one to decide which action to perform and a second one to choose the dependency in case of Left/Right action None of these variants produced improvements in precision.
    Only a small improvement in labeled attachment score was noticed using the full, nonspecialized classifier to decide the action but discarding its suggestion for
