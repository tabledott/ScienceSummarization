ty, and to keep the analogy to the HMM terminology of which this is a generalization.'
    Note that for scanned states, a is always a probability, since by definition a scanned state can occur only once along a path.
    The inner probabilities, on the other hand, represent the probability of generating a substring of the input from a given nonterminal, using a particular production.
    Inner probabilities are thus conditional on the presence of a given nonterminal X with expansion starting at position k, unlike the forward probabilities, which include the generation history starting with the initial state.
    The inner probabilities as defined here correspond closely to the quantities of the same name in Baker (1979).
    The sum of -y of all states with a given LHS X is exactly Baker's inner probability for X.
    The following is essentially a restatement of Lemma 2 in terms of forward and inner probabilities.
    It shows how to obtain the sentence and string probabilities we are interested in, provide
