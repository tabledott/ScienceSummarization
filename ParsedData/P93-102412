stortion-entropy parameters, which is equivalent to minimizing a linear combination of the two known as free energy in statistical mechanics.
    This analogy with statistical mechanics is not coincidental, and provides a better understanding of the clustering procedure.
    For the maximum likelihood argument, we start by estimating the likelihood of the sequence S of N independent observations of pairs (ni, vi).
    Using (1), the sequence's model log likelihood is Fixing the number of clusters (model size) ICI, we want to maximize /(S) with respect to the distributions p(nIc) and p(vIc).
    The variation of l(S) with respect to these distributions is with p(nIc) and p(vIc) kept normalized.
    Using Bayes's formula, we have since b logp = 6p/p.
    This expression is particularly useful when the cluster distributions p(nic) and p(vIc) have an exponential form, precisely what will be provided by the ME step described below.
    At this point we need to specify the clustering model in more detail.
