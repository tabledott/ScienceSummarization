l encoding scheme with reasonable interpretation as Bayesian prior, and at the same time allows an efficient algorithm for finding a model with the minimum description length.
    The uniform distribution assumption made in (4), namely that all nouns belonging to a class contained in the tree cut model are assigned the same probability, seems to be rather stringent.
    If one were to insist that the model be exactly accurate, then it would seem that the true model would be the word-based model resulting from no generalization at all.
    If we allow approximations, however, it is likely that some reasonable tree cut model with the uniform probability assumption will be a good approximation of the true distribution; in fact, a best model for a given data size.
    As we remarked earlier, as MDL balances between the fit to the data and the simplicity of the model, one can expect that the model selected by MDL will be a reasonable compromise.
    Nonetheless, it is still a shortcoming of our model that it conta
