ora resolution is its salience, which is de- termined by the status of the members of the COREF class it re.presents with respect to 10 contextual, gram- matical, and syntactic onstraints.
			Following (Lappin and Leass, 1994), we will refer to these constraints as "salience factors".
			Individual salience factors are asso- ciated with numerical values; the overall salience, or "salience weight" of a COREF is the sum of the values of the salience factors that are satisfied by some member of the COREF class (note that values may be satisfied at most once by each member of the class).
			The salience factors used by our algorithm are defined below with their values.
			Our salience factors mirror those used by (Lappin and Leass, 1994), with the exception of Poss-s, discussed below, and CNTX-S, which is sensitive to the context in which a discourse referent appears, where a context is a topically coherent segment of text, as deter- mined by a text-segmentation algorithm which follows (Hearst, 1994).
