ilingual text corpus (a bitext).
    Given a test set of aligned sentences, a better translation lexicon will contain a higher fraction of the (source word, target word) pairs in those sentences.
    This fraction can be computed either by token or by type, depending on the application.
    If only the words in the lexicon are considered, BiBLE gives an estimate of precision.
    If all the words in the text are considered, then BiBLE measures percent correct.
    The greater the overlap between the vocabulary of the test bitext and the vocabulary of the lexicon being evaluated, the more confidence can be placed in the BiBLE score.
    The BiBLE approach is suitable for many different evaluation tasks.
    Besides comparing different lexicons on different scales, BiBLE can be used to compare different parts of one lexicon that has been partitioned using some characteristic of its entries.
    For example, the quality of a lexicon's noun entries can be compared to the quality of its adjective entries; the qual
