 desiderata for a matching formalism.
    It is of course difficult to make precise claims as to what characteristics are necessary and/or sufficient for such a model, since no cognitive studies that are directly pertinent to bilingual constituent alignment are available.
    Nonetheless, most related previous parallel corpus analysis models share certain conceptual approaches with ours, loosely based on cross-linguistic theories related to constituency, case frames, or thematic roles, as well as computational feasibility needs.
    Below we survey the most common constraints and discuss their relation to ITGs.
    Crossing Constraints.
    Arrangements where the matchings between subtrees cross each another are prohibited by crossing constraints, unless the subtrees' immediate parent constituents are also matched to each other.
    For example, given the constituent matchings depicted as solid lines in Figure 4, the dotted-line matchings corresponding to potential lexical translations would be ruled illegal.
