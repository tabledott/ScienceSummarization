r all four corpora were used in this experiment.
    Following the format of Table 5, the results for this bakeoff are shown in Table 6.
    We chose the three models that achieved at least one best score in the closed tests from Emerson (2005), as well as the sub-word-based model of Zhang et al. (2006) for comparison.
    Row &#8220;Zh-a&#8221; and &#8220;Zh-b&#8221; represent the pure sub-word CRF model and the confidence-based combination of the CRF and rule-based models, respectively.
    Again, our model achieved better overall accuracy than the majority of the other models.
    One system to achieve comparable accuracy with our system is Zh-b, which improves upon the sub-word CRF model (Zh-a) by combining it with an independent dictionary-based submodel and improving the accuracy of known words.
    In comparison, our system is based on a single perceptron model.
    In summary, closed tests for both the first and the second bakeoff showed competitive results for our system compared with the best result
