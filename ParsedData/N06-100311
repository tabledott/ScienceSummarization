n our translation model that exploits paraphrases.
    We tested the usefulness of the paraphrase feature function by performing an additional experiment where the phrase table was expanded but the paraphrase probability was omitted.
    We evaluated the efficacy of using paraphrases in three ways: by calculating the Bleu score for the translated output, by measuring the increase in coverage when including paraphrases, and through a targeted manual evaluation of the phrasal translations of unseen phrases to determine how many of the newly covered phrases were accurately translated. were manually word-aligned.
    This allowed us to equate unseen phrases with their corresponding English phrase.
    In this case enumeradas with listed.
    Although Bleu is currently the standard metric for MT evaluation, we believe that it may not meaningfully measure translation improvements in our setup.
    By substituting a paraphrase for an unknown source phrase there is a strong chance that its translation may also be a p
