n phrase wide scope when it occurs as a prepositional phrase noun complement to a function word, e.g., every side of a triangle, then form should come before scoped-form in line (3) when pull has been called from line (4) in apply where the first argument to apply is a complex term for a noun phrase satisfying those conditions, e.g., the complex term for every side of a triangle.
    The modifications turn out to be quite complicated if we wish to order quantifiers according to lexical heuristics, such as having each outscope some.
    Because of the recursive nature of the algorithm, there are limits to the amount of ordering that can be done in this manner.
    At the most, we can sometimes guarantee that the best scoping comes first.
    Of course, one can always associate a score with each reading as it is being generated and sort the list afterwards.
    The algorithm as presented will operate correctly only for input structures that are themselves well-formed.
    For instance, they must contain no unbo
