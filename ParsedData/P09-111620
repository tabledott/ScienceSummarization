o up to 5 of the 67 categories.
    Table 5 shows three example queries and their classes.
    Three independent human labelers classified 800 queries that were randomly selected from the Here, &#8216;tagged as&#8217; refer to systems outputs and &#8216;labeled as&#8217; refer to human judgments.
    The subscript i ranges over all the query classes.
    Table 6 shows the scores of each of the three human labelers when each of them is evaluated against the other two.
    It can be seen that the consistency among the labelers is quite low, indicating that the query classification task is very difficult even for humans.
    To maximize the little information we have about the query classes, we treat the words in query class names as additional example queries.
    For example, we added three queries: living, tools, and hardware to the class Living\Tools &amp; Hardware.
    Since the query classes are not mutually exclusive, we treat the query classification task as 67 binary classification problems.
