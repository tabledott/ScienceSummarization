that several of the clusters capture syntactically salient morphological regularities: regular verb suffixes, noun suffixes and the presence of capitalisation are all detected, together with a class for numbers.
    In some cases these are split amongst more than one class, thus giving classes with high precision and low recall.
    We made no attempt to adjust the regular expressions to make these scores high &#8212; we merely present them as an aid to an intuitive understanding of the composition of these clusters.
  
  
    Up until now we have considered only hard clusters, where each word is unambiguously assigned to a single class.
    Clearly, because of lexical ambiguity, we would like to be able to assign some words to more than one class.
    This is sometimes called soft clustering.
    Space does not permit an extensive analysis of the situation.
    We shall therefore report briefly on some experiments we have performed and our conclusions largely leaving this as an area for future research.
