ed in assessing ordering algorithms (Karamanis 2003; Lapata 2003; Althaus, Karamanis, and Koller 2004; Barzilay and Lee 2004).
    The underlying assumption is that the original sentence order in the source document must be coherent, and so we should prefer models that rank it higher than other permutations.
    Because we do not know the relative quality of different permutations, our corpus includes only pairwise rankings that comprise the original document and one of its permutations.
    Given k original documents, each with n randomly generated permutations, we obtain k &#183; n (trivially) annotated pairwise rankings for training and testing.
    Using the technique described herein, we collected data4 in two different genres: newspaper articles and accident reports written by government officials.
    The first collection consists of Associated Press articles from the North American News Corpus on the topic of earthquakes (Earthquakes).
    The second includes narratives from the National Transportatio
