 the elementary tree anchored by the transitive verb hit in which both the subject NP and object NP are realized within the same elementary tree.
    LTAG is distinguished from other grammar formalisms by possessing part (2) of the EDL property.
    In LTAGs, there is one elementary tree for every syntactic environment that the anchor may appear in.
    Each elementary tree encodes the linear order of the arguments of the anchor in a particular syntactic environment.
    For example, a transitive verb such as hit is associated with both the elementary tree shown in Figure 9(b) for a declarative transitive sentence such as sentence 2, and the elementary tree shown in Figure 9(c) for an object extracted transitive sentence such as sentence 3.
    Notice that the object noun phrase is realized to the left of the subject noun phrase in the object extraction tree.
    As a consequence of the fact that LTAGs possess the part (2) of the EDL property, the derivation structures in LTAGs contain the information of a de
