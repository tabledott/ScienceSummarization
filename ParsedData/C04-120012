 of the sentiments, not the strengths: Model 0: ?
			(signs in region) The intuition here is something like ?negatives cancel one another out?.
			Here the system assigns the same sentiment to both ?the California Supreme Court agreed that the state?s new term-limit law was constitutional?
			and ?the California Supreme Court disagreed that the state?s new term-limit law was unconstitutional?.
			For this model, we also included negation words such as not and never to reverse the sentiment polarity.
			Model 1 is the harmonic mean (average) of the sentiment strengths in the region: Model 1: cwcp wcp cn scP ij n i i = = ? = )|(argmax if ,)|( )( 1)|( j 1 Here n(c) is the number of words in the region whose sentiment category is c. If a region contains more and stronger positive than negative words, the sentiment will be positive.
			Model 2 is the geometric mean: Model 2: cwcpif wcpscP ij n i i cn = ?= ? = ? )|(argmax ,)|(10)|( j 1 1)( 2.2.4 Examples The following are two example outputs.
