: When neutral instances are excluded, the performance of features for distinguishing between positive and negative polarity greatly improves.
    A focus of this research is on understanding which features are important for recognizing contextual polarity.
    We experiment with a wide variety of linguistically motivated features, and we evaluate the performance of these features using several different machine learning algorithms.
    Features for distinguishing between neutral and polar instances are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between positive and negative contextual polarity.
    For classifying neutral and polar instances, we find that, although some features produce significant improvements over the baseline in terms of polar or neutral recall or precision, it is the combination of features together that is needed to achieve significant improvements in accuracy.
    For classifying positive and negative contextual polarity, features for capturing negation prove to be the most impo
