lity that X and Y are probabilities of validity.
    A validity threshold (T ) of morphological variants is directly derivable from the 85% would mean that the four bottom PPMVs cost of transforming C1 into C2. would be deemed invalid.
    Yet if we find that the The only question remaining is how to determine local contexts of these low-scoring word pairs Cost(C1&lt;C2).
    This cost should depend on a number match the contexts of other PPMVs having high of factors: the frequency of the rule f(C1&lt;C2), the scores (i.e., those whose scores exceed T ), then reliability of the metric in comparison to that of their probabilities of validity should increase.
    If we semantics (a, where a e [0,1]), and the frequencies could compute a syntax-based probability for these of other rules involving C1 and C2.
    We define the words, namely Pr syntax, then assuming independence orthographic probability of validity as we would have: algorithm to compute Prsyntax.
    Essentially, the algorithm has two major componen
