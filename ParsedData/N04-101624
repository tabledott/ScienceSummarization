ropose and evaluate an unsupervised probabilistic model of compound noun interpretation for domain independent text.
    By recasting the interpretation problem in terms of paraphrasing, Lauer assumes that the semantic relations of compound heads and modifiers can be expressed via prepositions that (in contrast to abstract semantic relations) can be found in a corpus.
    For example, in order to interpret war story, one needs to find in a corpus related paraphrases: story about the war, story of the war, story in the war, etc.
    Lauer uses eight prepositions for the paraphrasing task (of, for, in, at, on, from, with, about).
    A simple model of compound noun paraphrasing is shown in (6): Lauer (1995) points out that the above model contains one parameter for every triple (p,n1,n2), and as a result hundreds of millions of training instances would be necessary.
    As an alternative to (6), he proposes the model in (7) which combines the probability of the modifier given a certain preposition with the prob
