transitive verb the following statistical inference step was performed.
    Given a latent class model pLc(.) for verb-noun pairs, and a sample n1, , nm of subjects for a fixed intransitive verb, we calculate the probability of an arbitrary subject n E N by: The estimation of the parameter-vector 0 = (Ocic e C) can be formalized in the EM framework by viewing p(n) or p(c, n) as a function of 0 for fixed pLc(.).
    The re-estimation formulae resulting from the incomplete data estimation for these probability functions have the following form (1(n) is the frequency of n in the sample of subjects of the fixed verb): A similar EM induction process can be applied also to pairs of nouns, thus enabling induction of latent semantic annotations for transitive verb frames.
    Given a LC model NA.) for verb-noun pairs, and a sample (ni, n2)1, , (n, n) of noun arguments (ni subjects, and n2 direct objects) for a fixed transitive verb, we calculate the probability of its noun argument pairs by: in an EM framework by vie
