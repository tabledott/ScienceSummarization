edictions depend on world knowledge, and many state-of-the-art systems use information from external resources such as WordNet, which can add a layer that helps the system to recognize semantic connections between the various lexicalized mentions in the text.
    Therefore, the use of WordNet was allowed, even for the closed track.
    Since word senses in OntoNotes are predominantly3 coarse-grained groupings of WordNet senses, systems could also map from the predicted or goldstandard word senses provided to the sets of underlying WordNet senses.
    Another significant piece of knowledge that is particularly useful for coreference but that is not available in the layers of OntoNotes is that of number and gender.
    There are many different ways of predicting these values, with differing accuracies, so in order to ensure that participants in the closed track were working from the same data, thus allowing clearer algorithmic comparisons, we specified a particular table of number and gender predictions generat
