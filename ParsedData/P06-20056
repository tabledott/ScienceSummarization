 consists of short-forms such as &#8220;b4&#8221; (before), &#8220;bf&#8221; (boyfriend).
    In addition, normalizing SMS text might require the context to be spanned over more than one lexical unit such as &#8220;lemme&#8221; (let me), &#8220;ur&#8221; (you are) etc.
    Therefore, the models used in spelling correction are inadequate for providing a complete solution for SMS normalization.
    Others may regard SMS normalization as a paraphrasing problem.
    Broadly speaking, paraphrases capture core aspects of variability in language, by representing equivalencies between different expressions that correspond to the same meaning.
    In most of the recent works (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shimohata, 2002), they are acquired (semi-) automatically from large comparable or parallel corpora using lexical and morpho-syntactic information.
    Text paraphrasing works on clean texts in which contextual and lexical-syntactic features can be extracted and used to find &#8220;approximate conceptual equivalence&#8
