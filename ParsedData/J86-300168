tion to believe, whose proposition is a generalization of the &#8212;p expressed in (4).
    Consider also the primary intention 14.
    It occurs in a segment embedded within DS2, is more general than 12, but is an approximation to it.
    It would not be surprising to discover that OCPs can in fact predict something close to 12 on the basis of 14, utterances (9)-(14), and the partial dominance hierarchy available at each point in the discourse.
    The focus space structure enables certain processing decisions to be made locally.
    In particular, it limits the information that must be considered in recognizing the DSP as well as that considered in identifying the referents of certain classes of definite noun phrases.
    A primary role of the focus space stack is to constrain the range of DSPs considered as candidates for domination or satisfaction-precedence of the DSP of the current segment.
    Only those DSPs in some space on the focusing stack are viable prospects.
    As a result of this use of the
