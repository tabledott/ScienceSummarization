at implicit from the training data, our rule-based algorithm is able to produce a series of transformations with a high segmentation accuracy.
    A common approach to word segmentation is to use a variation of the maximum matching algorithm, frequently referred to as the &amp;quot;greedy algorithm.&amp;quot; The greedy algorithm starts at the first character in a text and, using a word list for the language being segmented, attempts to find the longest word in the list starting with that character.
    If a word is found, the maximum-matching algorithm marks a boundary at the end of the longest word, then begins the same longest match search starting at the character following the match.
    If no match is found in the word list, the greedy algorithm simply skips that character and begins the search starting at the next character.
    In this manner, an initial segmentation can be obtained that is more informed than a simple character-as-word approach.
    We applied the maximum matching algorithm to the tes
