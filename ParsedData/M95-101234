The most interesting form of domain inference is not compositional of course, but based on discours e considerations.
  In the present ST task, for example, succession events are not always fully fleshed out, bu t depend for their complete interpretation on information provided earlier in the discourse .
  In the walkthrough message, this kind of contextualized interpretation is required early on : Yesterday, McCann made official what had been widely anticipated : Mr. James, 57 years old, is stepping down a s chief executive officer on July 1 [ .
  He will be succeeded by Mr. Donner, 45.
  ST-level phrasing and interpretation of this passage produces two relevant facts, a job-out for the firs t clause, and a successor for the second .
  Note that although successor is normally a two-place relation, its valence here is one by virtue of the phraser not finding a named person as a subject to the clause .
