 (monolingual) strings generated by G for the first and second output languages are denoted L1(G) and L2(G), respectively.
  
  
    We now show that every ITG can be expressed as an equivalent ITG in a 2-normal form that simplifies algorithms and analyses on ITGs.
    In particular, the parsing algorithm of the next section operates on ITGs in normal form.
    The availability of a 2-normal form is a noteworthy characteristic of ITGs; no such normal form is available for unrestricted context-free (syntax-directed) transduction grammars (Aho and Ullman 1969b).
    The proof closely follows that for standard CFGs, and the proofs of the lemmas are omitted.
    Lemma 1 For any inversion transduction grammar G, there exists an equivalent inversion transduction grammar G' where T(G) = T(G'), such that: For any inversion transduction grammar G, there exists an equivalent inversion transduction grammar G' where T(G) = T(G'), such that the right-hand side of any production of G' contains either a single terminal-pair
