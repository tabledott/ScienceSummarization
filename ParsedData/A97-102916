oded&amp;quot; in time linear to the number of tokens in the sentence, 0(m) (Viterbi, 1967).
    Since we are interested in recovering the name-class state sequence, we pursue eight theories at every given step of the algorithm.
  
  
    Initially, the word-feature was not in the model; instead the system relied on a third-level back-off partof-speech tag, which in turn was computed by our stochastic part-of-speech tagger.
    The tags were taken at face value: there were not k-best tags; the system treated the part-of-speech tagger as a &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot;.
    Although the part-of-speech tagger used capitalization to help it determine proper-noun tags, this feature was only implicit in the model, and then only after two levels of back-off!
    Also, the capitalization of a word was submerged in the muddiness of part-of-speech tags, which can &amp;quot;smear&amp;quot; the capitalization probability mass over several tags.
    Because it seemed that capitalization would be a good name-predicting fe
