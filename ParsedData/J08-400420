h item with the number of judgments it received for each category; Siegel and Castellan (1988) use a similar table, which Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) call an agreement table.
    Table 3 is an example of an agreement table, in which the same 100 utterances from Table 1 are labeled by three coders instead of two.
    Di Eugenio and Glass (page 97) note that compared to contingency tables like Table 1, agreement tables like Table 3 lose information because they do not say which coder gave each judgment.
    This information is not used in the calculation of rc, but is necessary for determining the individual coders&#8217; distributions in the calculation of x.
    (Agreement tables also add information compared to contingency tables, namely, the identity of the items that make up each contingency class, but this information is not used in the calculation of either x or rc.)
    Let nik stand for the number of times an item i is classified in category k (i.e., the number of coders that make such a judgment): For
