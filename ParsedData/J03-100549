 the ultimate goal of the Verbmobil project is the translation of spoken language, the input used for the translation experiments reported on in this article is mainly the (more or less) correct orthographic transcription of the spoken sentences.
    Thus, the effects of spontaneous speech are present in the corpus; the effect of speech recognition errors, however, is not covered.
    The corpus consists of 58,073 training pairs; its characteristics are given in Table 5.
    For the translation experiments, a trigram language model with a perplexity of 28.1 is used.
    The following two test corpora are used for the translation experiments: TEST-331: This test set consists of 331 test sentences.
    Only automatic evaluation is carried out on this test corpus: The WER and the mWER are computed.
    For each test sentence in the source language there is a range of acceptable reference translations (six on average) provided by a human translator, who is asked to produce word-to-word translations wherever it is
