oor alignment.
			This in turn affects the quality of the translation probabilities.
			Several extensions to the current IIMM based model could be used to tackle these problems: * The results presented here did not use the concept of the empty word.
			For the HMM- based model this, however, requires a second- order rather than a first-order model.

			In addition to the absolute or relative align- ment positions, the alignment probabilities can be assumed to depend on part of speech tags or on the words themselves.

			5 Conclusion.
			In this paper, we have presented an itMM-based approach for rnodelling word aligmnents in par- allel texts.
			The characteristic feature of this ap- proach is to make the alignment probabilities ex- plicitly dependent on the alignment position of the previous word.
			We have tested the model suc- cessfully on real data.
			The HMM-based approach produces translation pro
