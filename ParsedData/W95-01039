se backing-off continues in the same way.
    The idea here is to use MLE estimates based on lower order n-grams if counts are not high enough to make an accurate estimate at the current level.
    The cut off frequencies (c1, c2....) are thresholds determining whether to back-off or not at each level - counts lower than ci at stage i are deemed to be too low to give an accurate estimate, so in this case backing-off continues.
    (al, a2,....) are normalisation constants which ensure that conditional probabilities sum to one.
    Note that the estimation of (w w1, w2....wn_i) is analogous to the estimation of P( 1I v, nl, p, n2), and the above method can therefore also be applied to the PP-attachment problem.
    For example a simple method for estimation of nl, p, n2) would go from MLE estimates of Ally, n1, p, n2) to nl, p) to j3(1 v, iii) to polo to pm.
    However a crucial difference between the two problems is that in the n-gram task the words w1 to Tun are sequential, giving a natural order in which b
