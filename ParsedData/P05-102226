rses are already of state-of-the-art quality, but the reranker further improves the f-score.
  
  
    This paper has described a dynamic programming n-best parsing algorithm that utilizes a heuristic coarse-to-fine refinement of parses.
    Because the coarse-to-fine approach prunes the set of possible parse edges beforehand, a simple approach which enumerates the n-best analyses of each parse edge is not only practical but quite efficient.
    We use the 50-best parses produced by this algorithm as input to a MaxEnt discriminative reranker.
    The reranker selects the best parse from this set of parses using a wide variety of features.
    The system we described here has an f-score of 0.91 when trained and tested using the standard PARSEVAL framework.
    This result is only slightly higher than the highest reported result for this test-set, Bod&#8217;s (.907) (Bod, 2003).
    More to the point, however, is that the system we describe is reasonably efficient so it can be used for the kind of routine parsi
