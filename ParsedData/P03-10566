n, 1998) for discussion) and NP-conjunct versus flat NP coordinations but are hardly analyzed at all for any other language.
    More recently, however, a wider variety of parsed corpora has become available in other languages.
    We take advantage of the recently released Penn Chinese Treebank (version 2.0, abbreviated here as CTB; (Xue et al., 2002)) to address these questions for Chinese, a language with less morphology and more mixed headedness than English.
    Chinese, as we will show, has a rather different set of salient ambiguities from the perspective of statistical parsing.
    This section provides background on relevant linguistic differences between Chinese and English, and on relevant tree-structural differences between the two treebanks.
    1.1 Linguistic differences between English and Chinese Chinese and English are both isolating languages: they rely primarily on relatively rigid phrase structure rather than rich morphological information to encode functional relations between elements.
