    This suggests that it should be possible to tune a system to the kinds of Named Entities that occur in its particular genre of text.
    To test this hypothesis, we wanted to know how the system would perform if it started with no gazetteers, started processing texts, then built up gazetteers as it goes along, and then uses these gazetteers on a new set of texts in the same domain.
    We simulated these conditions by taking 30 of the 100 official MUG articles and extracting all the names of people, organisations and locations and using these as the only gazetteers, thereby ensuring that we had e
