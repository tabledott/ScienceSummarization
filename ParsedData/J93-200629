    The problem of partial interpretation when no complete interpretation can be found is touched upon in Section 4.
    Probabilities can quantify the likelihood of alternative complete interpretations of a sentence.
    In these experiments, we used the grammar of the Delphi component from BBN's HARC system (Stallard 1989), which combines syntax and semantics in a unification formalism.
    We employed a context-free model, which estimates the probability of each rule in the grammar independently (in contrast to a context-sensitive model, such as the tri-tag model described above, which bases the probability of a tag on what other tags are in the adjacent context).
    In the context-free model, we associate a probability with each rule of the grammar.
    For each distinct major category (left-hand side) of the grammar, there is a set of context-free rules For each rule, one estimates the probability of the right-hand side given the lefthand side, p(RHS
