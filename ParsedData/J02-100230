gatives and false positives with probability 0.5.
    Since we are working with reference segmentations of 1,000 segments, this means 500 missed boundaries and 500 incorrect boundaries.
    Since the probabilities are uniformly distributed across all segments and all boundaries, on average one would expect the following distribution of errors: A Type A error is a standard false positive, so the average penalty is k2.
    A Type B error is a standard false negative, so the average penalty is k. It remains to figure out what the average penalty is for a Type C error.
    Modeling the behavior of the metric, a Type C error occurrence in which a false positive and a false negative are some distance e &lt; k from each other incurs a penalty of 2e, where e is assigned for the false positive and another e is assigned for the false negative.
    This may range from 0 to 2k, and since error distribution is uniform, the penalty is k on average&#8212;the same as for a regular false negative.
    To translate this into a
