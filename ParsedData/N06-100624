first PASCAL RTE workshop reported accuracy from 49% to 59%, and CWS from 50.0% to 69.0% (Dagan et al., 2005).
    Table 2 shows results for a range of systems and testing conditions.
    We report accuracy and CWS on each RTE data set.
    The baseline for all experiments is random guessing, which always attains 50% accuracy.
    We show comparable results from recent systems based on lexical similarity (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), graph alignment (Haghighi et al., 2005), weighted abduction (Raina et al., 2005), and a mixed system including theorem proving (Bos and Markert, 2005).
    We then show results for our system under several different training regimes.
    The row labeled &#8220;alignment only&#8221; describes experiments in which all features except the alignment score are turned off.
    We predict entailment just in case the alignment score exceeds a threshold which is optimized on development data.
    &#8220;Hand-tuning&#8221; describes experiments in which all features are on, but no training
