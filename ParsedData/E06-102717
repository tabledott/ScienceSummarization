ing that the words identified by the system many times as bearing positive or negativesentiment are more central to the respective cate gories.
			The number of times the word has been fetched by STEP runs is reflected in the Gross Overlap Measure produced by the system.
			Insome cases, there was a disagreement between dif ferent runs on the sentiment assigned to the word.Such disagreements were addressed by comput ing the Net Overlap Scores for each of the found words: the total number of runs assigning the worda negative sentiment was subtracted from the to tal of the runs that consider it positive.
			Thus, the greater the number of runs fetching the word (i.e.,Gross Overlap) and the greater the agreement be tween these runs on the assigned sentiment, the higher the Net Overlap Score of this word.The Net Overlap scores obtained for each iden tified word were then used to stratify these wordsinto groups that reflect positive or negative dis tance of these words from the zero score.
			The zero score was as
