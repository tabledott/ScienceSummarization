    Instead, our focus is on methods of using an automatically acquired thesaurus for detecting compositionality of candidate phrasals output from our parser.
    We contrast this with some statistics commonly used for multiword extraction.
    The thesaurus is acquired from the grammatical relations occurring with verbs, both the target phrasals and their simplex counterparts.
    The intuition is that the neighbours of the simplex verb should be similar to those of the phrasal where the phrasal has a compositional meaning, and that the phrasal neighbours should include phrasal candidates with the same particle.
    For evaluation, we obtain a sample of multiword candidates from our parser and then obtain human judgements of compositionality using an ordinal scale for compositionality.
    We demonstrate that there is highly significant agreement on the rank order of these judgements and use the average ranks for each item
