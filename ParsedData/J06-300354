m guessing (but not significantly).
    It appears that the designers of the SAT questions deliberately chose distractors that would thwart these two strategies.
    With 374 questions and six word pairs per question (one stem and five choices), there are 2,244 pairs in the input set.
    In step 2, introducing alternate pairs multiplies the number of pairs by four, resulting in 8,976 pairs.
    In step 5, for each pair A:B, we add B:A, yielding 17,952 pairs.
    However, some pairs are dropped because they correspond to zero vectors (they do not appear together in a window of five words in the WMTS corpus).
    Also, a few words do not appear in Lin&#8217;s thesaurus, and some word pairs appear twice in the SAT questions (e.g., lion:cat).
    The sparse matrix (step 7) has 17,232 rows (word pairs) and 8,000 columns (patterns), with a density of 5.8% (percentage of nonzero values).
    Table 13 gives the time required for each step of LRA, a total of almost 9 days.
    All of the steps used a single CPU on a
