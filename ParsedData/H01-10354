  DATA RESOURCES The data sets used in these experiments included the English- French Canadian Hansards, the English-Chinese Hong Kong Han- sards, and parallel Czech-English Reader?s Digest collection.
  In addition, multiple versions of the Bible were used, including the French Douay-Rheims Bible, Spanish Reina Valera Bible, and three English Bible Versions (King James, New International and Re- vised Standard), automatically verse-aligned in multiple pairings.

  The tag- ging and bracketing tasks utilized approximately 2 million words in each language, with the sample sizes for morphology induc- tion given in Table 3.
  All word alignments utilized strictly raw- word-based model variants for English
