pairs, where |Gi |is the total 2 number of instances that belong to GS class Gi.
    Let F(K) be the set of instance pairs that exist in the automatically induced clusters and F(S) be the set of instance pairs that exist in the gold standard.
    Precision can be defined as the number of common instance pairs between the two sets to the total number of pairs in the clustering solution (Equation 7), while recall can be defined as the number of common instance pairs between the two sets to the total number of pairs in the gold standard (Equation 8).
    Finally, precision and recall are combined to produce the harmonic mean stance pairs for C1 , &#65533;70&#65533; for C2, &#65533;71&#65533; for C3 and &#65533;5&#65533; for C4, resulting in a total of 5505 instance 2 2 pairs.
    In the same vein, we can generate &#65533;36 total, the GS classes contain 5820 instance pairs.
    There are 3435 common instance pairs, hence precision is equal to 62.39%, recall is equal to 59.09% and paired F-Score is equal to 60.69
