 text of PREi/j contains TREj/i; else F. I/J RELATED CONTAINS U if no Wikipedia page titled as TREi/j is available.
    Else T if at least one Wikipedia hyperlink of PREi/j contains TREj/i; else F. I/J CATEGORIES CONTAINS U if no Wikipedia page titled as TREi/j is available.
    Else T if the list of categories PREi/j belongs to contains TREj/i; else F. GLOSS OVERLAP the overlap score between the first paragraph of text of PREi and PREj.
    Following Banerjee &amp; Pedersen (2003) we compute the score as &amp; m2 for n phrasal m-word overlaps.
    Additionally, we use the Wikipedia category graph.
    We ported the WordNet similarity path length based measures to the Wikipedia category graph.
    However, the category relations in Wikipedia cannot only be interpreted as corresponding to is-a links in a taxonomy since they denote meronymic relations as well.
    Therefore, the Wikipedia-based measures are to be taken as semantic relatedness measures.
